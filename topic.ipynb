I tried cymbalta for a week and my Dr decided that since it kept me awake 24/7 that it wasn&#039;t a good fit for me even though it relieved my pain. I started with 25 mg. After 2 weeks I had some breakthrough pain, so my Dr increased my dosage to 50mg and I&#039;m still on that dosage today. For the first full year I was on this I never had pain and felt &#039;cured&#039;. As time went on, it seems to help control my pain. I do still have pain, but at a low manageable level. I take this around 7pm each evening to avoid feeling overly drowsy in the mornings. This med allows me to have a fairly normal life.',\n",

I was taken a lot of different meds for all these problems, but nothing worked. When I was first put on this medication at 25mg I could sleep for the first time in years. I was waking up on the morning refreshed and happy. I noticed about 6 months later my migraines were not as often as I normally would have them. As time went on I needed my meds to be increased. I now take 150mg. This drug is a life saver. My fibromyalgia pain is less, migraines less, anxiety way less and it also improved my IBS C symptoms. I would recommend this Medication to anyone with any of these problem',\n",

The pain brought me to tears.  I was afraid that I would have to go on disibility.  My new urologist put me on amytripyline a few weeks ago.  It worked almost immediately. Most days I&#039;m almost pain-free.  I got my life back.',\n",

Finally I found a new Nerologist who put me on a combo of Amitriptyline and Prozac.  I am on both the smallest doses.  It has been a miracle for my pain.  I wish I would have known about this 7 years ago.  My biggest problem with it is weight gain like 13 pounds.  My diet has not changed and I took up running.  But no weight comes off.  I guess I rather have less pain and be a little over weight then skinny and in tons of pain:)',\n",

Actually didn&#039;t sleep well but I think I was on high alert for the side effects which didn&#039;t happen. A bit groggy in morning but nothing special that I can&#039;t deal with. I think the way to go is to build up if you are scared of meds like me. \\r\\n\\r\\nI wrote this to encourage others to try the medicine because I am as scared as anyone to take drugs like this. \\r\\nI',\n",

That could have been tolerable, however, if it were not for the hallucinations I suffered once I would lay down. It felt as though people were pushing on the mattress and grabbing at my feet. It was so bad, in fact, that it caused me to have to sleep with the light on, and I&#039;m a 32 year old man! This ultimately caused me to have to stop taking this.',\n",

And then I found Amitriptyline.    At last.....Sleep.   That&#039;s all that mattered to begin with.  You simply cannot underestimate the power of sleep.  During the day I felt far less agitated and less stressed.

Everything else gave me really bad reactions from burning skin to heart burn, palpitations, shortness of breath, insomnia just to name a few and even worsened my anxiety and led to more panic attacks. The only problem with Ativan was that because it is a Benzo and it is highly addictive so my doctor did not want to prescribe that anymore. My migraines got so severe that I was seen by a Neurologist last week and he prescribed AMITRIPTYLINE so far it&#039;s working wonders . I am able sleep through the whole night and my panic attacks are gone!!!!!',\n",

Helps with insomnia tremendously. Sometimes the daytime sedation can last a long time at higher doses, and you&#039;ll probably get dry mouth, constipation, or blurry vision/dizziness, at least at first. This medication works great for a lot of people when other things fail, just be aware that the trade off is that some annoying side effects are fairly common. Myself, the benefits far outweigh the negatives.',\n",

Blackouts, memory loss, numbness in face, lathargic, more sleepy than usual, dry mouth and munchies. All those disappeared after a month or so.\\r\\nDid try to get off it to see how my anxiety could manage on its own. Withdrawals were pretty miserable.

Ambien worked fine until its side effects kicked in then I stopped taking it because the side effects were unreasonable. \\r\\nAmitriptyline helped me sleep until one night I awoke to buzzing in my ears/head. \\r\\nFrom reasoning there might be lifelong buzzing in my head I discontinued the Amitriptyline. Shortly after discontinuing the buzzing went away and never returned. \\r\\nBottome line: there are much better oral&#039;s to take to assist in sleeping.\\r\\nI feel Amitriptyline did however correct a brain imbalance that was produced by the Ambien; and I found the culprit to my insomnia: I have an adrenaline allergy, from stress, anxiety and screen-time.',\n",

Pain was gone. Urgency/frequency cut in half.  But I immediately started gaining weight. A lot of weight, and fast.  And I am diabetic and any weight gain is very bad for me.  So I&#039;ve had to choose to not take it and live with the pain and constant peeing because I cannot afford to gain any weight due the diabetes.  I&#039;m basically distraught.

My migraines initially lessened in intensity to the extent that now I just feel very tired on the days when I would have had one - this I can cope with.

And because of these hallucinations, I haven&#039;t been able to sleep well.

I normally leave the t-bag in the cup until I have drunk it.\\r\\nAll these things have worked for me and I have not had any Panic attacks for approx 3 years.\\r\\nAlso if you suffer with Policeman&#039;s heel while walking, the only cure for that is : Sketcher&#039;s Shape-ups, I have been wearing them  for years and my pain has completely disappeared, I buy mine on line.',\n",

The only side effects I&#039;ve noticed are that it makes me drowsy in the first few hours of taking my dose. The first month or two of taking I would experience extremely vivid nightmares, but those have subsided to simply being vivid dreams some of the time.

I took propranolol for two years, but it didn&#039;t reduce the frequency or severity of my migraines at all.   I strongly recommend that every migraine sufferer try this preventative. After much reading, I discovered that I have a serotonin deficiency.  Amitriptyline works to keep serotonin levels elevated which is the root cause of migraines for many folks.  If you have tried this medicine before, try it again and try a different dosage.   Amitriptyline at 25 mg only reduced my migraines by 10%.   50 mg per day has reduced them by 95%.',\n",

It was a miserable and emotional ride for me and the people that care about me.  I can truly say I feel your pain and I pray that you find peace.

The neurologist I saw for my fibromyalgia suggested switching from Doxepin to Amitriptyline. Overall, I am glad I made the switch, as my fibromyalgia is now much more manageable. I take 35 mg of amitriptyline nightly. Initially very sedating, but now less so. It has also helped my irritable bowel syndrome. On the negative side, it has led to constipation problems, and my irritable bladder (bladder urgency) is now much more chronic, which is surprising because amitriptyline has higher anticholinergic properties.

The laparoscopy recovery was horrendous, painful, the trapped gas in my chest was soul destroying ... it was the worst thing I have ever been through. The coil on the other hand has been an unexpected blessing. I am about 3 months post having it fitted. Month 1 I experienced bleeding daily, but light. Month 2 I had a couple of spotting days. Its now month 3 and it appears that my periods have stopped. I still get twinges and sharp pains in my hip bones and coxic bone daily that last a few seconds.
