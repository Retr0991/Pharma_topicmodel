The insertion was very uncomfortable for me, but I think it had something to do with the fact that I was incredibly nervous and my cramps that come along with my period had never been very bad, so I didn&#039;t know what to expect. I was in about 6/10 pain for a few hours after because i took ibuprofen as my Dr recommended, but tylenol is usually what works for me so after I took some the pain decreased significantly. I was able to go to work afterwards and now my periods are lighter and MUCH shorter than before. I would recommend an IUD to anyone looking for a long-lasting bc method.",

She is great and fast. That being said it took two try for her to put my IUD in. The first time she had to send me home with a prescription to soften my cervix and I was on the end of my period. It is just a very stubborn cervix, she doesn&#039;t like to be touched. It was extremely uncomfortable to say the least!!!!!!!!! Both times. However totally doable. The second time we got it in just fine. I had some major cramping but nothing i am not already use too. I was a bit lite headed , my Doc told me that would happen. I was fine after a few minutes though and could walk out just fine. I cramped for the rest of the day. The first time my husband and I had sex everything went fine. However 30 to 45 minutes later I started to have extreme discomfort and cramping. Four weeks later and I am spotting constantly, extreme cramps, Tender sore swollen breast and incredibly bloated. I see my doctor in 2 more weeks. I sincerely hope the side effects go away. Because three years without having to take birth control would be nice. If they don&#039;t I will have to have this removed I am in constant pain in discomfort.",

My first bc was the mirena, I had that for a year and had to get off due to having so much pain. after that was removed I got the nexplanon. I had that for 5 months and bled EVERY day. I got that removed on 6/16/16 and right after taking it out I got the skyla put in. it was uncomfortable, but really just a pressured cramp. I had cramps that night but the following day I felt fine and had unprotected sex (24 hrs after getting skyla), no pain at all. I am on day 4 of having skyla and have been cramping all day. it is different for everyone, but only you know your body and what you can and cant handle."

I stressed so much and read reviews and they said not to stress because it makes it worse and trust me ladies... You cannot stress out. It finally came on the 17th and I&#039;ve never been so happy to have my period. Really ladies, be patient and the sooner you take it, the more effective it will be, so take the pill very soon. Good luck to everyone and also I did not have any side effects to taking this pill, so I would rate this a 10/10.",

He did not finish inside me. However, the next morning I started to freak out and was worried about getting pregnant from pre-ejaculation. We are both 17 years old and in no position to be having a baby. I got the pill about 48 hours after the incident. A day after taking it I started to bleed heavy for 3 days. I had no other symptoms at first but about 2 weeks later I got extremely bloated and my breasts started to hurt. I got my period 2 days early. I just want to say that even though this pill may work it is not something to rely on. Make sure to wear a condom. Be safe!!",

Both freaking out we went to cvs and I took the pill about an hour or 2 after the fact. I did start to bleed the following week for about a day then it turned into brown discharge for the next 2 days. A side affect of this drug is depression and I experienced that for 2 weeks. A month later my period was late exactly one week but I finally got it and I could not be happier. This pill really does work!!! Anyone who is freaking out just take the pill right away and you will be fine, it could definitely make your period late so no worries!!! Thank god for plan b!"

It was really the only option for me though, I have had very heavy periods since having my 2 kids. My Dr. recommended an ablation to control the bleeding, but when she sent me to an ob, she said Mirena could be something to think about. Hubby and I are done with kids, so this is only to control the bleeding. Anyways when I went in for the Mirena I barely felt a thing. A little bit of cramping that was it. Since then, I have had some spotting here and there. But no acne, weight gain, or moodiness. Sex drive is still great as ever. Nothing had changed for me. Everyone is different. You will only know how your body will react if you try it.",

Five years ago I decided to do the Mirena, the insertion process was a little painful, very little spotting the first couple of weeks, then no periods at all. I love the Mirena, I have had no more acne then I had before the Mirena, gained no weight, and only on occasion have slight bloating and cramps. Just yesterday since my Five years were up in May, I had my second Mirena put in. I love this product, I have had no problems with it, and I do recommend it to friends and family. It is nice to have peace of mind and not worry about remembering to take a pill. There is no other form of contraception I would use again.",

I had it the first time for 5 years then had it taken out due to the 5 year period and got put on the pill. The pill was not for me at all. So I decided to get the mirena again. I do not have a child. The mirena did hurt when I got it put in and did have bad cramping and some spotting but it was no unbearable. I was fine the next day. I have no gained weight being on the mirena or have had trouble with it. I still sometimes spot And my period is not regular anymore but that comes with it. I personally believe if you are not ready or do not want to have a child right now the mirena is the best thing!"

It actually wasn&#039;t that bad. The pinch of my cervix was the least painful thing. The dilation of my cervix is what hurt the most! The procedure only took about 3 minutes. The only problem I had was that my strings were way too long but my doctor fixed that. I had my first period about three days after insertion &amp; it was a bit heavy &amp; cramps. After about 5 days I had no more bleeding until the next months period. It was a lot lighter than normal. Hopefully by my next period I will have nothing at all. I recommend this BC!

That night I did not sleep the cramps were so bad I was crying and contemplating having my boyfriend take me to the hospital. The cramps stayed around for about another 7 day with them decreasing around the 4th day. I was bleeding for about two weeks then it stopped a couple days and started back. I never know if it is my period or just my random bleeding.. I am trying to stick with it but I think I will have it removed soon.",

The insertion was painful for about 30 seconds (really bad cramping). About an hour later I had some bleeding then some heavy cramps, but after taking Midol they went away. I bled for about 4 weeks straight and had some pretty bad cramps during that time. After that, my period became normal (only once a month for 4-5 days with light to normal bleeding). I do experience some bad cramping from time to time, mostly before my period and a few days after it stops, but after taking Midol or Aleve, it goes away. I also have a history of ovarian cysts and endometriosis but have not had any problems with that since my Skyla! I recommend this!"

I was skeptical at first, being that I hopped on the internet and started reading reviews and pretty much all I saw were people saying how bad the pain was getting it inserted and that the pain was worse to get it removed. The pain getting it inserted was NOT as bad as I was expecting. It literally just was a cramp that was a smidge more painful than I was use to. Besides that, the insertion was not bad. I cramped/bled for about a month then after that my periods started to slowly lighten up and now 3 years later I basically have no period (which is awesome considering before my IUD I had the worst periods). I recommend Skyla to everyone.",
                "tweet_1": "Skyla is the third birth control method I&rsquo;ve tried. To date, I&rsquo;ve had an IUD for ten months before getting it out today. In regards to its effectiveness and convenience, it&rsquo;s a 10/10 option for birth control. No condoms or trips to the pharmacy for refills in ten months, and no pregnancies. It&rsquo;s nice to not have to actively think of your birth control, especially if you lead a busy life. However, there were some downsides to this method, which is why I\ufe0f switched back to the pill today. The insertion process was unbearably painful for me, I\ufe0f&#039;d rate it a 9/10. I&rsquo;ve always had heavy periods with severe menstrual cramping, and this was by far the worst pain I&rsquo;d ever experienced. After insertion, I\ufe0f experienced mild cramping for the rest of the day, but experienced sporadic, severe cramping for the first two months. Like, &ldquo;knock the wind out of you, can&rsquo;t walk or talk&rdquo; cramping, and it would come and go in spontaneous waves. Those passed after the first 2 months and for the remaining 8, I\ufe0f experienced cramping maybe two or three times and it was when I\ufe0f got my period. Speaking of, I\ufe0f spotted for a no more than two weeks after insertion; my periods became significantly lighter during the first three months and by the fourth plateaued out but remained light the rest of the time. I noticed the more long-term side effects I\ufe0f experienced with Skyla around the 6th month- which were fatigue, weight gain, acne, irritability, and mood swings. The acne is mild, but the weight gain, irritability and mood swings were more significant. I\ufe0f gained about 25 pounds within the ten months and I\ufe0f noticed I was tired, irritable and hormonal all the time- not just when I\ufe0f had my period. I\ufe0f waited a few months to rule out any other factors contributing to these symptoms and to see if they&rsquo;d subside, but they remained. So, I\ufe0f switched to a low-dose birth control pill today, Taytulla. It contains estrogen and progestin, instead of just progestin like Skyla. Hopefully, my symptoms will begin to disappear. Skyla was effective, but unfortunately didn&rsquo;t react well with my body chemistry. But it&rsquo;s different for everyone.",
                "tweet_2": "I liked the idea of the Skyla IUD but I had nothing but problems with it since after the first two months. I had a constant BV infection that was treated over and over but would not go away. My partner would feel the IUD during sex the last few weeks I had the IUD. Not sure why all of a sudden but I thought it was coming out. He would feel it more and more and it was very uncomfortable for us both. I would bleed and cramp pretty bad after sex as well. (I had Skyla for a total of 8 months) I wish it worked out for me because it was effective and did its job. My body just did not agree with this particular IUD."

Given, I don&rsquo;t have the highest pain tolerance, but I was truly in a lot of pain for about a month after. Getting the IUD put in was so painful for me. The actual process only took about 10 minutes, but I sat in the room being fanned by a poor nurse and her giving me juice so I didn&rsquo;t pass out for an hour.

As she was inserting the IUD it felt like the worst period cramp of my life, but was bearable. The whole thing from start (insertion of the speculum) to finish lasted probably 5 minutes. After it was over, she let me lay down for a little bit due to the cramping. The cramps lasted the rest of the day but were gone the following day. I had a heavy period for 3 straight weeks afterward, and 1 more later on, but nothing since. I had to make an appointment for 4 weeks later to have an ultrasound to make sure the IUD was still in place. All in all, I would suggest a hormonal IUD (Skyla or Mirena) to anyone who is able to get one!",

I had been on the pill for a couple years and had not had my period in a while, my first period after the IUD lasted 9 days.  After that I had a couple days of spotting each month and now, about 3 months later, I have no period at all.  I have no skin or mood issues with this IUD, and minimal bloating.  This is so worth it to have no period or worries about pregnancy."

The past month I have had no real period and no cramping, but I am spotting pretty much every day.  It does vary from bright red blood, to some days the brown blood.  Not really enjoying it, however I did read beforehand that this was pretty normal for the first few months.  Other than that, no side effects.  Still happy with my decision to do it.",

I was miserable. Bent over crying and it hurt so bad it made me vomit so my husband took me to the ER thinking it had gone out of place, turns out it was &quot;normal&quot; pain. So they gave me pain medicine and sent me home. After that I bled for 3 weeks still with cramps and spotted for a few months, while still getting my period. Everything has been fine up until about two months ago and I&#039;ve started getting really bad cramps again. Like I did when I first had it inserted. I am not sure what is going on but with this much pain I am seriously considering getting it taken out.",

Took ibuprofen 800mg an hour before insertion. It was just like getting a pap. The most painful part for me was pinching the cervix to straighten the uterus. It was like a period cramp but the whole insertion procedure lasted around 3 mins. Just a little uncomfortable but pain is tolerable. Period cramps are worse. For the price and efficacy and just the slight pain during insertion, I think it&rsquo;s worth getting especially as I don&rsquo;t have to worry about unwanted pregnancies for up to 5 years.\r\n\r\nNo dizziness nor cramping afterwards. No pain too. Just a small drop of blood on the liner."

I spotted for a day or two but I was on my period when it was inserted, so if anything it seems to have stopped my period. Had sex yesterday, 3 days post-insertion and was totally normal.

The pro is that Liletta was very effective in avoiding pregnancy and it got rid of my period. The con is that I experienced frequent painful headaches, cramping before my periods (which is new to me), painful sex from sharp ovary pain and dryness, low libido, acne, weight gain, and serious bloating. For removal, I had to get my cervix dilated because the strings curled up inside. Two months have passed and now I&#039;m 15lbs down &amp; symptoms have faded",

My second period I had no pain but was still bleeding for about 2 weeks.

Because I had my period when  I got my liletta inserted cramping and pain was normal for me..but afterwards spotting is still there and I have mild cramps and back pain. I am in week 4 so its still too early for me to say if I like it  but for now its on and off but I am not bothered. I know everyone is different.

I have noticed that I have to go to the bathroom significantly more often. But that&#039;s the only real complaint I have.  Was on the pill before and this is has been so much of a better experience.

In the first two weeks I also had some minor mood swings but nothing compared to how I felt on the pill. My periods are so light I just need a panty liner for about three days and then its over.

On or about the 90th day I saw spotting again in time for my normal cycle to begin, it was just that spotting, nothing else, I could only see it when I wiped and I only needed to wear a liner This lasted for 3 days. I&#039;m sure the spotting has stopped"

It works in the sense that you wont get pregnant but the pain I have from this every day is NOT worth it, I&#039;d much rather take the pill. The procedure was short but the pain from it was the worst thing I have ever gone through not to mention I was dizzy for the rest of the day after. I also suffer from severe cramps almost every day since then. Also it could make you completely lose your fertility and cause serious issues. If I could go back I would have never had it put in. I plan on having it removed very soon. Worst decision ever!!!",

They will also make excuses when asked to have it removed telling you to wait. \r\nAfter 5 years of pain, no sex life as the cramping is not worth it. finally i was granted my wish to have it removed. Unfortunately it was surgically as it had went into my uterine wall. The doctors fail to mention this product can ruin lives as im not sure if i can have children. Threads were still visible and had regular checks too. \r\n3 days it has been gone and my headaces, cramps, pain down my leg gone with it.\r\nYes it stops pregnancy but at the cost of it being potentally permanent and also the lack of sex drive.\r\nMy advice please avoid."

The pros are that you don&#039;t have to worry for pregnancy or taking a pill daily and also it is one of the most effective birth control methods. The cons are that I was bleeding for almost 2 months when I got it inserted. After that I have had my regular period lasting about 2 more day than before (I&#039;m very regular though). The pain when I got it inserted wasn&#039;t that bad, it just lasted about 1 minute and for the cramps I just had a couple tylenols and that was just enough. I would recommend it for women that are 100% sure that they don&#039;t want to get pregnant for sure for at least 3 years and only if you have one partner. It is worth it. That is my personal experience so far.",

I haven&rsquo;t cramped that badly since insertion but my first period was long about 7 day and heavy. Kyleena is starting to grow on me but the weight gain really bothers me. However, I just got married and in nursing school so I love not taking a pill everyday. I will review again in 6 months!"

I still kept it because I didn&#039;t want to go through the hassle of having it removed after over a year of having it. I also started breaking out badly and gaining weight fast. Before I had the birth control I had clear and an even skin tone and was 125 lbs and after a little over a year I had gained 20 lbs and had horrible acne that would not go away no matter what I did.

I have less acne, I have not had a period for 7 months which is GREAT, and I have not gained more weight.

The other bad thing for me is that my periods are out of control. I started out having it for a month and a half straight, then it went away for a week and I got it again for 2 months. It would go away for 2 months and it would come back for a week and so on. It is very unpredictable.

                "tweet_2": "Hi everyone, my name is Emma . I would just like to tell people my story of having the Implanon and the side effects I have experienced during this time. I got my first implant 7 years ago.\r\nMy experiences with the implant have been awful! And this is the reason I would like to give people an idea of what it can do to your body to hopefully help people deciding whether the implant is for them or if people are experiencing symptoms like the ones I had, then it is most likely due to the implant and the doctors really don&#039;t have a clue, as I was told by my GP on several occasions &quot;no it will not be the implant that is causing this, when in reality I knew it was&quot; and when I had it removed it confirmed that I was right. So here is my story.. \r\n\r\nWith the implant I gained so much weight which I have been unable to loose.\r\n\r\nI bled heavily during sex and when I say heavily I mean it went everywhere!! And this was on every occasion during intercourse and when I explained to my GP, in her head there was no way it was the implant! And this was when I was not bleeding, which wasn&#039;t very often.. this really does affect your life, your sex life, and your relationships. \r\n\r\nI bled almost all the time without a break, which makes you feel so uncomfortable and self conscious. I never had clean knickers!! I know, not nice. \r\n\r\nMy hormones have been everywhere since I I got the implant also  depression, anxiety etc. \r\n\r\nPain during Intercourse was a big issue while on the implant. I had so much pain that sometimes I could not have sex with my partner. Sometimes I would not lubricate myself which was also another symptom. Gp did not help with this either, apart from offer me lubricant!! \r\n\r\nIf I was not bleeding, I had dark browny discharge. Until having the implant removed I cannot remember the last time I wore white knickers.\r\n\r\nThere are so much more but these are the main symptoms I have experienced more recently. I had my implant removed on the 6/11/17 and when having it removed I was intimidated by the nurse who was removing it, she was very rude!! Anyway.. I stopped bleeding straight away. I started my period on the 10/11/17. Which lasted 4-5 days. I have never bled since, not even a spot!! Me and my partner can finally enjoy intercourse without the worry about me bleeding, or being sore. I can even wear WHITE knickers now and they stay WHITE!!!! ITS AMAZING!! I have never felt so happy! I was starting to doubt my body while on the implant. I thought, my body isn&#039;t normal, there&#039;s something wrong with me, at one point I thought I had cervical cancer due the the bleeding during sex. My whole life has changed since having the implant removed, I feel so much better and back to normal, whatever normal is.. \r\n\r\nI really hope that by sharing my experience, if I can even help one person I will be happy\u263a\ufe0f. Thank you for reading and if anyone would like to write to me in regards to this feel free to do so. Thank you."

I feel protected and it wasn&#039;t as scary getting it done as it sounded I will never use any other form of birth control. I honestly feel like this is the best option out there.

I had problems with acne in the beginning, but for my first time ever using a hormonal birth control, and having really acne prone skin that was expected. I also did gain a little weight (like 5 pounds) but it was probably due to a stressful lifestyle and not so healthy eating choices. and the best thing, I haven&#039;t gotten my period since before I got this. Every now and then I get slight cramping like I am going to get my period but I never actually get it, just slight spotting every 6 months or so for about a day but that is it."

I also have been breaking out NONSTOP since Christmas, my acne has never been this AWFUL.

While it did its job by not getting me pregnant it has a ton of side effects. First my arm gets the extreme pains where the implant is at random times. When I got the thing I was around 210 and I had recently just lost 50 pounds and I was feeling great about myself. Well now I weigh 281 and I believe it is because when I got the implant I started to crave certain foods and they wouldn&#039;t go away until I had it. The third thing is it made me extremely moody all of the time. My family and I have and I have been evaluating my behavior and I get angry for no reason all of the time. Last thing my periods happen 2 a month and they last 7-10 days!",

However I was on my period from the time I got the implant until the day I got it taken out. It caused me to have horrible mood swings and it made me very short with people. I noticed I got mad at little things and just was moody a lot. No other side effects. My doctor recommended it be taken out because I had not stopped bleeding.

A couple of days later it came back on for two days and stopped. I will say that about 2 months in when my period was due to come on it didn&#039;t show. Instead, I had the worst freaking cramps ever! It literally felt like contractions! My ob warned me about possibly having horrible pain within the first and second month.

It would have been nice to have been aware of this before getting it put in. Some people bleed for a couple weeks or maybe a month and others for as long as it&#039;s in them. I do not like this birth control at all. It has made me break out, gain weight, eat sooo much more, and I&#039;ve gone through about 7 jumbo boxes of tampons."

On the other hand I have broken out what feels like everywhere, I&#039;ve never had a problem with acne before. Also the day after I put it in I started getting really bad headaches and I felt upset.

But this second month I have had a small yeast infection and been pretty dry down there and my sex drive is not what it was but not gone.

                "tweet_1": "I have been using nuva ring for 6 months now after switching from the pill for 5 years. I have mixed emotions about nuva ring. I love the fact that it is very convenient and I never have to worry about taking a pill on time every day. I hardly have to thinkg about and most of the time I don&rsquo;t feel the ring at all, occasionally it slips down and I just have to push it back up- not a big deal. My periods actually seem heavier and last longer than what I experienced with the pill. I&rsquo;m hoping with continued use, they won&rsquo;t be as bad. Also, nuva ring is pretty expensive, I wish there was a generic version on the market. The biggest draw back for me is my diminished sex drive. My fianc&eacute; and I went from having sex at least 4-5 times a week to maybe once a week and that&rsquo;s because I force myself to. I&rsquo;m seriously considering switching back to the pill solely because of this. Other than the decreased sex drive, I haven&rsquo;t experienced any other side effects like weight gain or moodiness.",
                "tweet_2": "I have been on the NuvaRing for almost 6 years, I decided to try it due to the fact that I had a hard time remembering to take the pill every day. I absolutely love the ring and have recommended it to most of my friends. What first was initially hard for me was remembering what day and how many weeks it was in, I found an app for my phone which helped tremendously. The pros are definitely that you don&#039;t have to take it every day and it&#039;s comfortable, I sometimes forget that it is there. Cons would have to be the decrease in sex drive but a little exercise helps with that. I&#039;ve had no pregnancy scares or break through bleeding. All in all the ring beats the pill and the Depo shot."

I normally have bad PMS and mood swings and bad cramping.  My doctor has me using it in a way I only get a period every 3 months.  It has normalized my mood which is the main thing I was hoping for besides not getting pregnant. I have to switch though because there is no generic and my insurance only covers $10 of it. So it&#039;s expensive for me.",

I quit breastfeeding and decided to go on birth control until me and my husband wanted to try for another. I put it in on the first day of my period like the pamphlet and my gyn told me and I have been bleeding for 2 weeks! I originally got online to see if other women had this happen and even called my gyno to make sure everything was ok. Apparently it is just breakthrough bleeding eventhough you would think that would only be during the middle of the month not for 2 weeks straight! There are no cramps and its very little but extremely annoying. I do like that I can take it out during sex.",
                "tweet_2": "Great birth control that was easy convenient. All I did was just put it in for three weeks, forget about it, and then take it out after the three weeks is up. Sometimes I would have to take it out during sex, although other than that I did not experience any discomfort or it slipping out. This birth control did not make me gain any weight except for my boobs. I did experience vaginal dryness and extreme decrease in my sex drive, which really made sex unpleasurable at times. This birth control made me extremely tired all the time. I would just sleep for hours on and had little to no energy. I am currently off this bc due to that side effect. Caused me to have cystic acne after 5 months."

I gained a lot of weight being on the Patch but when I was on the Ring, I was able to lose the weight and stay the same weight. It actually made my periods lighter and I barely have cramps. The only thing I have negative to say is I have constant discharge and it does not feel like a regular period. But I prefer the light bleeding then the harsh periods I use to have. I highly recommend but the Ring is not for everyone.",

My skin in very clear-it could be from the ring. Very happy with it. I&#039;ve had sex a few times with it inside. My partner is well endowed and didn&#039;t feel it at all. I don&#039;t plan on taking it out during sex. The only complaints I have is that it made me a little irritable at the beginning and the hormones have increased my appetite. Right now I am in the process of leaving it in continuously so that&#039;s I don&#039;t get anemia. I have awful PMDD and also have a tendency to become anemic. Can&#039;t wait to never get it again. I&#039;ve tried a bunch of birth control pills: horrible side effects. Love the ring!",

I have to write on the calendar when to take it in and out because I never think of it. My libido is very low but I&#039;m not sure if that&#039;s me or the ring. No other side effects for me. My insurance changed and I can&#039;t afford it now. So bummed to go back to the pill."

My first few days on it were okay, I did not feel any of the symptoms besides a little bit of heavier cramping and more abdominal pain while on my period. However, when my period was over and I tried having sex for the first time with my boyfriend, my vagina didn&#039;t stop burning afterward. It probably lasted all night. Since then, every time I have sex, it&#039;s fine during but afterward is really painful. It burns when I pee, my pH makes me feel gross and sometimes gives a smell, and this lasts for the rest of the day! Trying to have sex a second time is soooo painful, it even becomes so dry down there that it makes it worse. Do not use Nuva Ring!!",

My face was covered! I had brown discharge after the first week, which I know was normal, but I occasionally got this foul smell and more discharge. It hurt too much to have it in during intercourse and it bothered my boyfriend too, it never stayed in good, I could always feel it at the opening of my vagina, but what made me take it out is the itchiness and burning feeling I get from it!! I couldn&#039;t take it. Honestly I felt gross the whole time having something inside of me all the time.",

The first day everything was fine, the second day I experienced the worst itch in my vagina, I mean terrible. I&#039;ve never had a yeast infection, and this is my first time trying birth control. It also made my vagina extremely dry. Sex did not really hurt but was hardly enjoyable BC I was not wet at all, and he said he pushed it back up there for me during sex.. Don&#039;t recommend this method of birth control at all, and I&#039;m really not sure where to go from here, as I am very wary of all the hormonal side effects of all methods of birth control. I am very disappointed and do not want to ever experience this kind of discomfort again."

I started losing my hair, got terrible acne and gained about 10 pounds.  After the first 6 months of this it calmed down and everything was great! No periods, nothing. Then about 12 months into it, I started bleeding for 3 weeks on and 2 weeks off, this went on for 6 months and then I had it removed.  No one wants to have 3 week long periods. I went to get it out &amp; the doc said she had to cut a second hole because it moved while she was trying to pry it out of the first one. It took about 30 minutes of poking and prodding! Not worth having such big scars.",

I tried to wait it out to see if my body would eventually adjust but my period never got itself to be on a cycle. It got to the point where it wasn&#039;t worth it because even when I did have sex, I had bleeding/spotting so it took away my sexual confidence. It definitely was effective and did its job but the side effects were getting in the way of my life as well as my wallet as I was always at the store buying tampons and pads (and we know how expensive this can be). I decided to get the implant removed which was a bit of a difficult experience as well. Nexplanon is effective but still needs improvement.",

I was told that my body would have to get use to the Nexplanon but after 3 months everything should be normal. That is not the case! I have gained 10 lbs so far, no sex drive &amp; I am depressed normally all of the time. This was not me before getting the Nexplanon!! I have decided to have it removed &amp; will have my consultation tomorrow. I cannot wait to get back to my BC pills. I rated this a 3 only bc I haven&#039;t gotten pregnant."

My period is not consistent, but I don&#039;t usually get cramps and it is typically light. I will be off for about 2-3 months, and then will have a light period for about a month, the brownish blood. I trust this with my life, obviously, and I have not had any scares.

Like bleed for 2 weeks then a 3 day break and my period comes right back. I used to say how much I love it but it is now almost September 2015 so I have been having my period for about 3 months straight and it sucks. I have lost over 15 pounds from exercising since I have had it implanted so I wonder if that has anything to with the almost constant period.",

I would get irregular periods that were light, heavy, short, long, etc. I had cramps that caused me to spend days in bed or taking heavy medication.\r\n\r\nWhen I got Nexplanon, I got my period as usual for two months, but it stopped after that. No bleeding, bloating, cramps, or anything else. I have only this month started to get my period again, which I read is typical in the last year.\r\n\r\nI will definitely be getting another implant when I have to get this one removed."

I cramped and bled a lot. I had mood swings and nausea severely in the first three months. my face completely broke out. about two months after that first period I started bleeding and having pretty big blood clots for a little over 60 days straight.

Migraines, nausea, gained 20 lbs, even had hot flashes. I finally could not stand it anymore and had it removed. It took me three months to start my period.

However I was on my period from the time I got the implant until the day I got it taken out. It caused me to have horrible mood swings and it made me very short with people. I noticed I got mad at little things and just was moody a lot. No other side effects. My doctor recommended it be taken out because I had not stopped bleeding. A great birth control but just wasn&#039;t for my body."

I was always crying and sad, also depressed. After my period stopped I continued spotting for over a month. That was long enough for me so I wanted to take it out. I had my mom buy me walnuts cause that&rsquo;s what I was craving and I also heard that it makes bleeding stop. The next day the blood got lighter then it stopped. Now it&rsquo;s just discharge. Less mood swings. I&rsquo;m honestly satisfied with it now. Very effective by the way. Wouldn&rsquo;t recommend as first choice.",

I know that is not a ton of weight. but I am 5&quot;5 and weighed 108 pounds. I go to the gym at least 3 times a week, and I eat pretty healthy most of the time. I have never had a problem with weight until now. Other than these 2 side effects, this birth control is great. I love that you don&#039;t have to worry about it once it&#039;s in.

I went for a check up and my doctor put me on a low dose of birth control pills and told me not to take the placebo (last week of the pills) and see if that helps. I did that for about 6 months no change what so ever it just got worse. Once I hit 3 months of none stop spotting and bad mood swings I decided that it was time to get it removed. I had it removed and got the depo shot in the same day. The doctors said that we have to give it 3 more months for my body to adjust. I just want to have a normal period again!!"

I have to say there is actually a significant difference between the two. I was irregular the entire time I was on Implanon, very heavy bleeding and frequent periods. The day of my &quot;refresher&quot; I was on my THIRD very heavy period between the beginning of August and the beginning of September. The day after the Nexplanon was inserted I have been period free, nothing to complain about on that matter, 4 months period free, I&#039;ll take it. However, the insertion method is much different than with the Implanon. The Nexplanon seems very shallow under my skin in comparison which makes it much more noticeable to me,annoying",

I got the next one, nexplanon, and have had it about two years. The cramping is horrendous at times, lasting two weeks or off and on regularly. My periods became a majority of the month by the second year of having nexplanon. I have always had anxiety but I personally feel that the nexplanon is making it worse and I was diagnosed with IBS (for the pain and stomach upset/anxiety). A part of me is terrified that if I take the nexplanon out my symptoms will get worse, but I can also tell you I&#039;ve never had these symptoms until I took Nexplanon. Be wary.",

When it timed out the doctors switched my implanon out with nexplanon, assuring me it was an even better form of implanon. What I can tell you is that the nexplanon is highly effective, no pregnancy scares here. But what I can tell you is I&#039;ve had some of the worst cramps of my life on this. Sometimes it&#039;s regular cramps and sometimes it&#039;s so severe I throw up. I have stuck it out for over a year with nexplanon but after no explanations for the pain- I am ready to have it removed. The three years on implanon were good but nexplanon is not so much.

The day after I start bleeding again and it&#039;s just blood clots and brownish red blood? I&#039;m just hoping my body is cleaning out the two month build up. Overall not bad and no side effects"

Throughout my life my weight has been up and down, for the days that I ate a lot, more or likely I gained two pound. This medicine will cause you dry mouth and over active on the first day that you take but after awhile your body will get used to it. The most amazing thing is you have to force yourself to eat!

I have the energy to get up and go when I would normally have a hard time getting motivated. I sometimes have to remind myself to eat because my food cravings are hardly there at all when I take the pill. I do notice that I get a dry mouth, but drinking water helps and I love this medication. I think it is amazing."

I was crying everyday at this point. I lost my father to cancer and the battle was very hard on me for three years. The sertraline has done wonders for me.

This frustrated me as I have always had a good sleep schedule and am an active person during the day, but I had read that others had experienced similar side effects and the effects eventually ceased. I felt better for several days%u2014not as downcast, brooding, heavy. \r\n\r\nAfter three weeks of taking it, the effect seemed to even out and I found myself struggling with feelings of hopelessness and doubt again. I felt better, certainly, just still struggling%u2014I don&#039;t expect a pill to %u201Ccure%u201D me of negative thoughts. I know I have control over my own thoughts, but it was that feeling of heaviness that tends to settle upon me%u2014like a dark cloud. When I went back to my doctor for the follow up, he increased it to 100 mg. I said let%u2019s try 75 mg first. He agreed. \r\n\r\nWithin a couple weeks of taking 75 mg I still yawned a lot but I wasn%u2019t having trouble with lethargy and sleep issues as much. My attitude was much better. For example, I found that I really am a funny and silly person! I forgot that I was funny being under depression. I didn%u2019t realize how serious I had become, how reclusive. I also found my creativity really opened up. I had forgotten how creative I was. I also have been going to the gym and eating well. I try and smile and interact with people more%u2014even if I don%u2019t feel like it. I may just greet people or hold the door for them but it%u2019s better than me avoiding people like I used to. Some days are harder than others, but I can say that overall my experience with sertraline has been positive."

Then I started to research more about it and there was so much negativity toward weight gain while on it, and I did gain 10 pounds so I started to panic because I am already 50 pounds overweight. So I went against better judgment and went off of it. I went around the mountain over and over again trying to find a better solution, &quot;Nothing was successful for me&quot;. I would rather be fat and happy than skinny and miserable for the rest of my life. I am going back on it in about a week. I am also going to be put on birth control pills to help with the hormones.

By the third, I was a basket case. This is also when the weight gain kicked in - I gained almost 15 lbs in 5-6 weeks. If I wasn&#039;t depressed before, this definitely did the trick. My Doctor then took me off the Yaz/Zoloft regimen and opted to stop my periods altogether, to stop the monthly hormone fluctuation. I have been on Seasonique for three months and it has been amazing! I am finally feeling back to myself after almost a year.",

It has been absolutely wonderful! The first couple of days I took the whole 25 mg in the morning. I found this to give me headaches and tremors. So I decided to split the pill in 2 pieces and take half in the morning and half with lunch. I only had to do this for about a week; I now take the whole 25 mg in the morning, with or without food, no problems. No serious side effects, definitely not enough to outweigh the benefits. Zoloft has absolutely given me my life back! I was afraid to take it, especially after all of the negative reviews, but I am so happy I gave it a try. Wonderful!"

I&#039;ve been taking Lexapro 10mg for almost 4 months now and I can confidently say the only scary thing about this medication is people&#039;s negative reviews on it. First and foremost EVERYONE is different, so everyone will react to it differently. I was prescribed it by my primary Doctor due to my severe anxiety and mild depression. Before this medication I was prescribed Celexa, but hated it. My anxiety and depression got so much worse I decided to do something about it. It came to the point where my anxiety and depression affected everyone around me and I just wasn&#039;t happy anymore.  At first taking this medication gave me some side affects. My side effects were really dry mouth, some intense dreams, and some loss of appetite. The only thing that has stuck for these few months have been the dreams. They seems SO REAL! But I can say I rather have some dreams than those scary anxiety attacks I use to get, and those depressed bed sobs. Lexapro has changed my life! Before this medication my life was hitting rock bottom. My Anxiety was so severe it took over my life. I obsessed over everything, overthought everything, felt like at any moment I was going to die. I was on edge every second. My blood pressure was always high and I&#039;m only 24! I had this obsession of dying in a car accident, it came to a point I couldnt ride in a car with anyone else unless I was driving. If I did I would get panic attacks. My depression was also bad and also had an eating disorder. I felt like I was never going to be happy. Was never going to be happy in a relationship, or in my job, or even be able to hug my own mother again. I&#039;m happy the people in my life noticed how much my disorders were taking over my life and helped me make a change. Lexapro helped my life. I hope my review will change yours."

It has been the first antidepressant to not only help with my everyday anxiety, depression and panic attacks but I have also had no side effects after taking it for the first month. I was overeating before I started with this medication and since I am no longer depressed all the time I have been able to lose some weight and get back to a more average weight for my height. I did have some sexual side effects throughout the first month but my body has adjusted and I no longer have those issues. I take this with Trazodone at bedtime and have also been sleeping a lot better since I started my medications. I would recommend giving it a try if you are dealing with anxiety or panic attacks.",

I checked with my Doctor and he prescribe me this medication. I was very nervous to take such a thing, because I&#039;ve never been on this or any other medicines. So he started me on a small dose. I&#039;ve been on for 4 weeks now. The first 2 days I had some side affects with a headache and not sleeping. On the 3rd day the side affects went away. The 5th day I started to feel good to go outside, walk the dog, just to get out of the house and get back to normal things that I used to do. I&#039;m very happy that I started this medicine. I&#039;m hoping that I won&#039;t have to take it for long. The medicine is awesome! Wish you well!",

I was scared to take it because of all of the side effects that i read about but the only side effects i experienced were headache, slight appetite loss, and tiredness (I switched to taking this medicine at night and that took care of the tiredness). For me the side effects only lasted about a week or two which wasn&#039;t bad at all, and I started feeling a change in my anxiety and mood within a few days. This medicine has allowed me to be happy, and I haven&#039;t been able to feel happy for this many continuous days in years. The thing that this medicine has helped the most for me is my social anxiety, now I can actually go out in public and be myself and I don&#039;t have to worry what others think of me."

I did occasionally take a low dose of Klonopin for the increased anxiety which really helped. After about 7-8 weeks I saw a huge improvement in my anxiety. I have not gained any weight and sleep very well,( I take it at night before bed). Wow. I finally feel back to myself. These reviews got me through the first month! Definitely stick it out and know that your body will adjust to the medicine! I will occasionally feel a little anxious but it passes quickly and I can cope so much better! Am so grateful that this is working and that I can enjoy my life again!!!",

My anxiety is much better and I can do more things. I went back to work and can attend social events again. \r\r\nThe negatives for me was how long it took for the meds to take effect (it was about 1-2 months of increased anxiety, loss of appetite, loss of sex drive, irritability) then it started to work and I increased my dosage to 15MG which is what I have been on since. I&#039;d say it took about 4-6 months for full effects and now I still feel anxiety but can handle it better. \r\r\nOther down side: if I forget my meds for a day or two I definitely feel the effects. I get increasingly dissociated and irritable for no reason"

Because I am very sensitive to medications and nausea, I fought to not take meds for fear it might get worse. The Cipralex and practicing CBT made me feel fearless. I could travel, drive, and function again. This is my second time being on it due to a new job and moving to a new province. I needed some extra support. I also eat well and exercise. I take 5mg because my anxiety/lifestyle is more managed over the years with exercise and meditation. On 5mg I actually feel so great! Increased appetite, relaxed, happy.",

Of the three, this has by far worked the best for me. One theme I kept reading during the early weeks when I first started taking the meds is that if can be a bit of a rough ride tapering up. That was the case for me. At first I felt totally out of it and also experienced difficulty getting to sleep. It has now been five weeks and I am taking 10mg. The problems getting to sleep have slowly gone and I feel better each day. My mind is clearer than it&#039;s been in months and I don&#039;t have the crazy irrational worry and OCD that were some of the reasons I was prescribed this in the first place.",

This time I&#039;ve only been taking 5mg. because of the side effects I got before, but due to certain circumstances in my life I need to increase it because my depression has worsened and my anxiety is very high. The reason I went on it again was because of anxiety attacks and my depression was not good. I really hate to have to increase it again because of the side effects but I have taken many other anti-depressants and their side effects were worse. I&#039;m very sensitive to medication in general even Tylenol makes me fall asleep lol. But I&#039;m also thing that maybe taking Clonazepam on a regular basis may help with my extreme anxiety."

I love the Mirena, I have had no more acne then I had before the Mirena, gained no weight, and only on occasion have slight bloating and cramps. Just yesterday since my Five years were up in May, I had my second Mirena put in. I love this product, I have had no problems with it, and I do recommend it to friends and family.

I have no gained weight being on the mirena or have had trouble with it. I still sometimes spot And my period is not regular anymore but that comes with it.

The effectiveness was wonderful, as my husband and I didnt use any other kind of birth control and I did not get pregnant.

I went back into for a checkup with my doctor to make sure it was in place, and he couldnt see it or feel the strings. So he told me that my body rejected it. So I thought he meant it fell out. I ended up going to the pill, and happen to be pregnant with my 3rd child. In 2015 I went to a chiropractor and had an xray done, and low and behold the iud was still in me.

Insertion was just a pinch and the nurse held my hand and talked me through it. Mild cramps for about a day afterwards. I had very light spotting periods for a few months after I got it in. And then my periods quit all together. I have bled 2 times since and it was after sex. And only for a wipe or 2. Not even panty liner worthy. No periods at all ladies. Amazing.

I didn&#039;t realize that mostly everything I have been feeling are likely side effects of the Mirena. Acne, horrible breast tenderness, tired, and mood swings.

Very pleased with not worrying about pregnancy.\r\n3. Periods are normal but extremely light.\r\n4. Some cramping after sex - some light bleeding after sex. No biggy.\r\n5. Had to have the strings cut shorter for my partner - he cannot even notice it now.\r\n6.

The nurse got me lying down on the bed again and these feelings went away. The cramping started at this time. I cramped that day, which was manageable with 2 Midol%u2019s and 2 Advil (which was a great combination for this procedure). For the next few days I would get a cramp once a day, no big deal.

After insertion, there was mild to moderate cramping but went away with ibuprofen.  I have had occasional spotting.  Sex drive is the same.  I have noticed that I have to go to the bathroom significantly more often. But that&#039;s the only real complaint I have.  Was on the pill before and this is has been so much of a better experience.

The past month I have had no real period and no cramping, but I am spotting pretty much every day.  It does vary from bright red blood, to some days the brown blood.  Not really enjoying it, however I did read beforehand that this was pretty normal for the first few months.  Other than that, no side effects.  Still happy with my decision to do it."

The only negatives I have about Mirena is that it does hurt sometimes during sex if the intercourse gets a little intense. Also, I am completely convinced that it is the cause of my weight gain.

Ever since I have not had any problems except for some bleeding the first 2 weeks which is normal and easily controlled by using a light pad.

It had gotten so bad I was flooding thru every 2 hrs and that was affecting my daily life during that week. I had to do something so I went for it. Insertion was painful but over quickly. I had mild cramping that day and spotting for about a week. After that I had some discharge for several more weeks that I only noticed when I used the bathroom and then it stopped. I have had 2 periods now after insertion and they have been wonderful. I went from flooding to not even needing to wear or use anything! I have not had any side effects or problems.

That being said, I have had no children and did not take my Advil as advised from the nurse prior to my appointment. Other than that I have only had light spotting and it has made my period lighter. Mirena is supposed to decrease your sex drive but honestly it has increased mine and my partner and I love it! I hope it stays this way and the bleeding/spotting stops soon!",

The day of insertion was spent in bed, but I was back to normal the next day. I hardly spot, the cramps come around during the time of the month, but they are not nearly as terrible as they were before Mirena. I was terrified of getting it after reading terrible reviews online, but I understood it works differently for everyone. My experience has been nothing but amazing, and my partner loves it! I don&#039;t have to worry about pills. Every once in while, I just have to make sure the strings are still there. At times, he can feel the strings but they do not poke or hurt him in any way."

I am 21 years old and don&#039;t have any children. Previously, I had heavy bleeding and had to get a blood transfusion and had to stay in hospital because of it. So my doctor decided Mirena would be the best for me. My husband and I do want to have children in the near future so this type of birth control is great because you dont have to worry about it and you can take it out in 6 month to a year. Overall I haven&#039;t had this for very long but I&#039;m liking it.",

I got it when I was 18 years old - I am not a candidate for most other forms of birth control because of my migraine headaches, so Mirena seemed like a good solution.  For insertion, my gynecologist numbed my cervix with an injection which helped buffer some of the pain. I experienced significant cramping for a few hours after it was put in, but a heat pad and a day of rest was enough to keep it very bearable. Since then my periods have become progressively lighter and shorter (now they only last for one day, and bleeding is so light that I rarely use pads or tampons), and I never get cramps. Bottom line = I love it. Talk to your gynecologist!",

I read so many reviews that made me hesitate to get it - it took me months to decide which birth control to get, but my Dr recommended this so I trusted her. I have had 1 child previously, 2 years ago now, so I think that helped make my experience smooth. I took some ibuprofen before getting it put in and there was discomfort but nothing unbearable. I spotted and had irregular periods for the first 2 months, it was really annoying. Then I spotted occasionally for another two months or so. My periods have stopped completely now so it was worth it. Also, the cramping was not bad at all. Nothing more than the moderate period pains I used to get. And my partner never notices it."

I&#039;m glad I kept it! 4 months later, my periods are so light and almost nonexistent. Yes, my acne got worse, but it was because it got better when I was on the pill. I think my acne just went back to its pre-birth control levels. No mood swings, no more cramping, great birth control (10 years and not a single pregnancy or even a scare!)

Took pain killers before and after it was fitted and bled for a few days and took two months for my periods to stop and very light, now I get spotting every four, five months for a few days. Had no problems with it, no side effects although I have read bad reviews with abdominal and breast pain, depression, no sex drive acne all sorts. I already get acne but not got any worse, I have lost a stone. And am very happy with my Mirena and I forget I have half the time.",

I had a month of heavy bleeding at first now its just a few days a month of light bleeding the rest of the time there is a light discharge whatever that is. It is annoying as I have to always wear a pantyliner. Good thing the Mirena has gotten rid of the heavy painful bleeding I had and my menstrual migraines (which used to last for 7-10 days every month). Yay! Only thing that really upsets me is the acne on my chin, though its more like rash type spots then full on acne it looks dreadful as my face has red splotches on it and its embarrassing. Still I would prefer to have that then the horrible pains and migraines that I used to.",

I rarely had cramps before I got it,  but since then I get pretty bad ones every few months. I broke out horribly from July-Dec, and it only got better because I took medication for my skin. The acne left dark purple marks on my cheeks, that are just barely disappearing. I gained about 10-15 lbs, but after about a year my body dropped back down to what I weighed before. It has prevented pregnancy, sex drive is about the same. After that year mark things were going great until about four months ago. Apparently my uterus lining has been getting worn down by the IUD. Bleeding for months straight. Every day."

Now I have been bleeding almost as heavily as a normal period for about a week (longer than they used to last).\r\n\r\nI am very excited for this adjustment period to be over and to stop bleeding.

I am married and I plan to stay on it for about three years. \r\n\r\nThe insertion process was a lot like having a Pap smear. It did not take very long however it was very painful (9/10) for about a minute. Afterwards I experienced a lot of cramping and discomfort for the rest of the day. I feel like although it was an unpleasant experience in the long term it is totally worth it. I never had major problems with the pill either however I did experience mood swings and a low libido. I also didn&#039;t like the fact that I had to remember to take it daily and I would often fail to take it at a consistent time.\r\n\r\nSince being on Mirena I have rarely gotten my period, (it has been nice not to think about tampons!) I did occasionally have some very light spotting in the first two months. I have been meaning to write this review for a while as I have been very pleased with my experience. I highly recommend it to others my age, it is a sensible, convenient option and I have been a much happier person ever since."

I gained 20 lbs and what was suppose to help my bleeding only cause me more trouble. Depo caused me to have no period for 6 wks then I would spot the next 6 weeks until next injection.

I have a history of painful periods and need something so I can function. On the Mirena I have some annoying but manageable cramps and no bleeding. More importantly, I have mood fluctuations (a good thing) but nothing like the PMS extremes. Insertion was not very bad (I have not had children) as long as you take some pain killer a few hours before and get the cervical softener in place in the vagina the night before. I also had an experienced doctor insert it. Definitely do your research before you get it inserted. Overall, this is working very well. I have even lost a few pounds!",

Prior to Mirena, I hadn&#039;t had a period in about 8 years (which I loved). The first 8 months or so after insertion were great. However, at month 9, I started a bleeding and had awful cramping which nothing helped (ibuprofen, heat packs, etc.).It was so bad and I was so unused to a period at that point (I was told I may have spotting the first 6mo after getting it put in, but that my period would most likely not restart),  that I made an appt with my gyno. Turns out, everything was fine. I just now have a very long, very painful period every month. I may go back to depo."

The other bad thing for me is that my periods are out of control. I started out having it for a month and a half straight, then it went away for a week and I got it again for 2 months. It would go away for 2 months and it would come back for a week and so on. It is very unpredictable.

I love the fact that I don&#039;t have to take a pill everyday and when I was on the pill, I forgot to take it a lot. Luckily I didn&#039;t get pregnant.

All I did was work eat and sleep I tried my hardest to stay up and go out but i just didn&#039;t have the energy. The doctor informed me that I would bleed for about 3months once I got the implant and then I would have a period once a month. That was not the case at all. I bled the entire time I had it until a got it removed on 10-23-13(the best day of my life)! I gained 20 pounds in 7 months and it was pretty much impossible for me to lose weight.

This is the only side effect that I have and it is hard because I have a very high sex drive but other than that I must honestly say that I love the Implanon a lot more than Depo and the pill. With the Implanon I know its there and I don&#039;t have to run to the doctor every 3 months or I don&#039;t have to remember to take it everyday at the same time.

I was very active so my doctor told me to not worry about a period it shouldn&#039;t come back until I get it out. Wrong! I have been bleeding since the day I got it in. I will get a few months with no period, then maybe spotting for like 4 days. Sometimes I&#039;ll bleed for one day. The worst is the long heavy periods. Every 2-3 months I&#039;ll get a period for about 20-25 days. Right now I&#039;m bleeding and it&#039;s my 22 day of non stop.  It works for not getting you pregnant though."

After 7 months (I know we waited) my periods were much more irregular and I was depressed and down for no reason. The only good thing about this is I haven&#039;t became pregnant.

I think that Implanon was definitely the right choice for me but it&#039;s different with everyone and anyone reading these comments should keep that in mind.  I was previously on the Depo shot for 2 years and have the same side effects on Implanon that I did with the shot.  I haven&#039;t gotten my period since it&#039;s been in, not even a little bleeding.  I have gained about 5-10 pounds but I am not a very active person.  I love not having to worry about getting pregnant or using a condom.  The only problem I have had is the extreme bruising and pain when I got it put in and it took a little over a week to heal all the way but I have a very minimal scar now."

So I decided to get on implanon after my daughter. I thought things was going okay but It is not and I really need this thing out of me ASAP. Since having this thing in my arm. I&#039;ve had non stop spotting and periods all month, no energy, mood swings, depression, dizziness on a daily and I&#039;ve been having tingling in my arm and legs but especially in the arm that the implant is in. I&#039;ve also experienced weight gain and sharp pains where the implant is inserted. I touch and feel it on a daily and it is still in the spot the doctor put it in.

I&#039;m not sure if I gained weight because of this product, but I was naturally always skinny before this product. I exercise and eat normally as I used to so I&#039;m not to sure if it is the Implanon implant. \r\nBut I love this birth control very much because it works well as far as not having to worry so much about it, but I have had mood swings especially now for no reason and a little lower sex drive.",
                "tweet_2": "Hi everyone, my name is Emma . I would just like to tell people my story of having the Implanon and the side effects I have experienced during this time. I got my first implant 7 years ago.\r\nMy experiences with the implant have been awful! And this is the reason I would like to give people an idea of what it can do to your body to hopefully help people deciding whether the implant is for them or if people are experiencing symptoms like the ones I had, then it is most likely due to the implant and the doctors really don&#039;t have a clue, as I was told by my GP on several occasions &quot;no it will not be the implant that is causing this, when in reality I knew it was&quot; and when I had it removed it confirmed that I was right. So here is my story.. \r\n\r\nWith the implant I gained so much weight which I have been unable to loose.\r\n\r\nI bled heavily during sex and when I say heavily I mean it went everywhere!! And this was on every occasion during intercourse and when I explained to my GP, in her head there was no way it was the implant! And this was when I was not bleeding, which wasn&#039;t very often.. this really does affect your life, your sex life, and your relationships. \r\n\r\nI bled almost all the time without a break, which makes you feel so uncomfortable and self conscious. I never had clean knickers!! I know, not nice. \r\n\r\nMy hormones have been everywhere since I I got the implant also  depression, anxiety etc. \r\n\r\nPain during Intercourse was a big issue while on the implant. I had so much pain that sometimes I could not have sex with my partner. Sometimes I would not lubricate myself which was also another symptom. Gp did not help with this either, apart from offer me lubricant!! \r\n\r\nIf I was not bleeding, I had dark browny discharge. Until having the implant removed I cannot remember the last time I wore white knickers.\r\n\r\nThere are so much more but these are the main symptoms I have experienced more recently. I had my implant removed on the 6/11/17 and when having it removed I was intimidated by the nurse who was removing it, she was very rude!! Anyway.. I stopped bleeding straight away. I started my period on the 10/11/17. Which lasted 4-5 days. I have never bled since, not even a spot!! Me and my partner can finally enjoy intercourse without the worry about me bleeding, or being sore. I can even wear WHITE knickers now and they stay WHITE!!!! ITS AMAZING!! I have never felt so happy! I was starting to doubt my body while on the implant. I thought, my body isn&#039;t normal, there&#039;s something wrong with me, at one point I thought I had cervical cancer due the the bleeding during sex. My whole life has changed since having the implant removed, I feel so much better and back to normal, whatever normal is.. \r\n\r\nI really hope that by sharing my experience, if I can even help one person I will be happy\u263a\ufe0f. Thank you for reading and if anyone would like to write to me in regards to this feel free to do so. Thank you."

It is really making me fed up and is affecting my work - is there anything else out there that would be better to take and will work for this problem!!! Its driving me mad as I have to work and the pain can be just too much."

The pain was really bad everyday and I also had to work so when I took meds I had to make sure I ate a good meal so it would not mess up my stomach or make me sleepy.

I kept going back and telling my dr that my pain was still severe.  It was a long process and a lot of undue pain.  In the very beginning,  gabapentin wasn&#039;t even prescribed, and I ended up in the emergency room due to excruciating pain.  The ER dr prescribed it....finally.  My pain was never really managed.  It&#039;s been 7 weeks and I feel like I might be able to lessen the dose soon.  Shingles is an awful disease."

There were time I actually thought I was going to go completely insane. Most night I didn&#039;t sleep more than an hour or two. Even then I was not getting a good deep sleep. When I asked my GP about gabapentin, he had no problem prescribing it for me. He even followed recommendation for the dosage. I take 100mg in the morning and at lunch. Before bedtime I take 200 mg..

However, I developed secondary pain--a deep, horrible ache in both thighs. It took me two months to even figure out that the pain in my legs was caused by the gabapentin (first of all, I suffer from RA, so pain is common; second, gabapentin is supposed to help with pain, not cause it, so this was confusing).  I went off the gabapentin (note: always consult a physician and taper down!), and sure enough, the debillitating thigh pain that I&#039;d been suffering so long went away.",

Problem is the unsteadiness, can&#039;t hold things and drop them, This is after I took it for one day and this is happening on day two. May just take it when the pain becomes unbearable.  I get it from the VA so I don&#039;t know if they have any other medication that treats the same problem and if so will ask to be given it for awhile to see if it works.

Now, I am off of it and want to get back on a low dose. I was up to the full 225 mg by the end but even the 75 helped my stomach. My stomach is now killing me and affecting my daily life. I get a lot of pain and a lot of time is spent on the toilet. I&#039;m pretty miserable sometimes and hope to get back on it or find something that works that well."

The first day I could feel this medication working, it was a little much at first but nothing I couldn&#039;t handle. But I soon noticed that it took all my emotions away and made me dull to everything going on around me and in my life. Most don&#039;t like that but I really do, I feel as if I have no cares in the world at all. Nothing goes through my head at all, its like magic. It takes me a little bit to actually get my brain going and operating but thats fine with me. Sleep and sex drive has gone down but I still get the sleep need and if I need to preform I can.  I just don&#039;t have the desire to want sex. Its changed my life in such good ways.",

I had to go back on the drug and come off it very slowly over about 3 months. I think now I have PTSD. Before taking this drug I only ever had depression and anxiety, but now I&#039;m a total wreck I&#039;ve lost my job my gf I&#039;ve still not got over the shaking.

I had/have MDD, GAD, SAD, and took Paxil for 10 years, which worked quite well until 8 months ago.  I was scared of switching because of the fact that not all anti-depressants work for everyone, and I was terrified of fully reverting back to my suicidal, petrified old self.  My psychiatrist was able to convince me after a couple months to go for it.  On the venlafaxine I feel calm, HAPPY, able to concentrate, mildly euphoric, and better than I did in my early days of taking Paxil.  This stuff is hit or miss for different people, but don&#039;t be scared to try it if you haven&#039;t.  And give it time to work.",
                "tweet_1": "I wanted to offer my support and experience with venlafaxine. I have never taken antidepressants.\r\n\r\nAfter an accident which had altered my lifestyle and enjoyment of life, I talked to my doctor. I did not want to risk going on pain meds (I know myself well enough that I fear possible addiction), and he suggested an antidepressant. I started at 75 for 2 weeks and increased to 150 after.\r\n\r\nInitially had weird experience of wanting to smile for no reason. I didn&#039;t like this as it almost seemed like mental gymnastics to reconcile this induced sense of excessive happiness and smiling at nothing. This has mostly subsided now after 1 month on 150.\r\n\r\nThe only other big side effect is sexual. Other men may understand where I am coming from. My libido is actually slightly higher (may be because I am no longer depressed), and I have no problem at all with arousal. However actually climaxing is a big effort. When it does finally happen though, it&#039;s more intense.\r\n\r\nOther than that, no side effects. On the major plus side, no more sleeping in and calling in sick to work. I have a renewed zest for life. It&#039;s amazing to look forward to waking up and starting my day! I start up conversations with strangers at the coffee shop and and have made new friends. If a negative thought enters my mind, it just seems to dissolve as quickly as it came.\r\n\r\nI am truly thrilled with this antidepressant and recommend.",
                "tweet_2": "Two and a half months ago I was prescribed Venlafaxine to help prevent chronic migraines.\r\nIt did help the migraines (reduced them by almost half), but with it came a host of side effects that were far worse than the problem I was trying to get rid of.\r\nHaving now come off of the stuff, I would not recommend anyone ever use Venlafaxine unless they suffer from extreme / suicidal depression. I mean extreme in the most emphatic sense of the word. \r\nBefore trying Venlafaxine, I was a writer. While on Venlafaxine, I could barely write or speak or communicate at all. More than that, I just didn&#039;t want to. Not normal for a usually outgoing extrovert.\r\nNow, I&#039;m beginning to write again - but my ability to speak and converse with others has deteriorated by about 95%. Writing these words is taking forever; keeping up in conversation with even one person is impossible, and I barely see the point of trying either. On Venlafaxine, words pretty much left me - my conversational vocabulary  was whittled down to the following:\r\n&quot;Mmm&quot; for yes; a sharp and clipped &quot;Mm&quot; for &quot;No&quot;\r\n&quot;Okay.&quot;\r\n&quot;Really?&quot;\r\n&quot;Oh right.&quot;\r\n&quot;Cool.&quot;\r\n&quot;That sucks&quot;\r\nAt the moment, I&#039;m a week into withdrawal, and I have to try extremely hard just to make the most mundane small talk. Last night I went to a party with some close friends, cheesy &#039;90s music, and a barbecue. About half of them are academics, and I couldn&#039;t keep up with conversations I normally would be able to; the other half like to dance and party, but I felt glued to my seat (as well as practically mute) and eventually walked off and found a quiet sofa to lie down on.\r\nI have never felt so isolated and lonely in my life. Thanks Venlafaxine.\r\nIf you consider yourself a social, creative, and curious person, DO NOT TAKE EVEN ONE DOSE OF VENLAFAXINE. Unless of course you are extremely extremely depressed. I&#039;ve suffered from depression in the past, but only mildly. Venlafaxine has shown me what true depression feels like.\r\nAs for the other side effects:\r\n- About two days&#039; worth of total joyful euphoria during the first 48 hours of taking Venlafaxine. Anxiety of all kinds evaporated. This felt amazing - although I can&#039;t remember what it felt like now. At the time, this extremely brief effect was powerful enough to make me feel that pushing on with Venlafaxine would be a Good Idea.\r\n- After that, I started feeling very sleepy. All the time. I slept more. No euphoria; more anxiety.\r\n- A week later, the night sweats started. My room was pretty cold (it was only spring in the UK), but I sweated more than I ever have on any tropical holiday. This meant that despite being extremely sleepy, I couldn&#039;t sleep.\r\nSince the side effects were supposed to wear off after six weeks or so, I stuck with Venlafaxine for six weeks. Over that time I became so sleep deprived that I lived in a state of permanent exhaustion.\r\nEnter the writer&#039;s worst enemy: Brain fog. I spent entire days so braindead that the most challenging thing I could manage was staring blankly at a wall - or lifting my phone to read text messages and attempt to learn something from articles about Venlafaxine. I&#039;ve read the same articles countless times, but nothing sank in; every time I read the same article it felt like I was reading it for the first time. I recognised the layout and design of each webpage, and that way I was able to realise I&#039;d read it before, but the actual text went in one eye and out the other.\r\nIn conversation, I had a brain like a sieve. Words went in one ear and out the other. Normally, I could pump out a lot of writing on a regular basis; on Venlafaxine, I wrote a small and frankly pitiful handful of short and uninspired pieces, and that was it. If you love being productive and creative, do not go near Venlafaxine.\r\nThe above was my life for six weeks - and that was enough. I did see family and friends while on Venlafaxine, but I constantly forgot what was going on and must have seemed scatterbrained or borderline retarded at times. Although I did explain to people what was going on with my medication, it just seemed to make people uncomfortable - and I&#039;ve now become the butt of a lot of jokes relating to my consistent uselessness at everything from chatting to party games and my inability to work or do anything productive. Someone even compared me to Lenny from Of Mice And Men and asked when my family were going to take me into the back garden and shoot me in the head rather than continue to care for me. All of this contributed to the worst feeling of loneliness and isolation I have ever experienced in my life.\r\nVenlafaxine not only trapped me inside my head - it also emptied my head of anything worth remembering, and left me barely able to learn new things. \r\nI&#039;d sit around tables with people and realise I couldn&#039;t remember the names of people I&#039;d know for years - or even family members. \r\nI&#039;d hear a song playing and say &quot;Hey - what&#039;s the name of this dance?&quot;\r\nAny sentence longer than a few words requires a minute or so to compose when written. Spoken out loud? Forget about it. When I try to speak, I sound like the Goon from Popeye.\r\nAfter six weeks of hell, my doctor and I agreed to taper off my 75mg daily dose. This process lasted a month, not following a particular schedule (which might have been a better idea), and was mostly side effect free until I came down to 18.25mg a day - one half of one 37.5mg tablet.\r\nAfter three days of that, it really hit the fan. I got up one day, pottered around a bit, and suddenly decided that I wanted to kill myself. Literally out of nowhere.\r\nFortunately I was of sound enough mind to call the Samaritans, who recommended I call the emergency services, who sent an ambulance to take me to hospital. For suicidal thoughts. \r\nTo be honest, I&#039;d rather have gone to Disneyland.\r\nOnce I was in A&amp;E, I got to wait for several hours, just stewing in a room with a sofa and not much else. Then I met the most useless doctor of all time. After I refused his suggestion that I not only go back on Venlafaxine, but *try a higher dose* than the one that got me into this mess in the first place, he said there wasn&#039;t anything else they could do - and handed me a little leaflet for a local mental health charity meetup that happens every so often.\r\nBy this point I&#039;d decided that suicide would not be the best option - and nor would going on even more Venlafaxine than before. I also binned the leaflet on my way out, determined to keep going and just deal with the withdrawal.\r\nSince that time, my intelligence level has plummeted to the point of being humiliating. But that&#039;s not even the worst of it.\r\nAs I mentioned before, I started taking Venlafaxine for migraines. Now that I&#039;m not taking it, they&#039;re coming back again - but they&#039;ve also changed.\r\nA few days ago, days before the party I should probably have stayed home for only I couldn&#039;t stand sitting at home any longer so I went and ended up alone in a darkened room and felt more depressed than I have in my entire life, I was at home when I collapsed. The right side of my body gave way, I hit the wall, and fell on the floor where I lay frozen for God knows how long. Then when I did get up, I realised I couldn&#039;t speak at all, the right side of my body was almost paralysed, and the right side of my head was numb on the outside, and in agony on the inside.\r\nAfter calling the emergency services again, I was taken through the standard questions I guess they ask everyone when they think the person in question is having a stroke. Like the suicidal thoughts, stroke symptoms were a new experience for me. Thanks, Venlafaxine.\r\nWhen the ambulance arrived, they were able to reassure me that I wasn&#039;t having a stroke, as one side of my face wasn&#039;t drooping. This was good news - but since they couldn&#039;t explain what was actually going on, I was taking to hospital for a brain scan and blood tests and a meeting with a doctor who told me I&#039;d had a right-sided hemiplegic migraine. I&#039;d never had one before, and didn&#039;t know they existed until then; my migraines have always felt like my head is both in a vice and exploding at the same time, and I get them across my whole head, not just one side.\r\nAt this point, I&#039;m determined to continue fighting the withdrawal symptoms. The only thing that&#039;s really helped me in doing this was the discovery of a cognitive distortion called &quot;emotional reasoning&quot;. This involves assuming that because you feel bad, things must actually be bad.\r\nObviously emotional reasoning (which is worth Googling as it&#039;s quite an in depth subject, or at least feels like it given that my brain&#039;s been hopefully temporarily damaged by Venlafaxine) is pretty common in depression. It&#039;s also been my brain&#039;s default way of operating possibly for as long as I can remember, but definitely since I started taking Venlafaxine. The emotional and physical and psychological rollercoaster Venlafaxine puts you through is utterly exhausting - and while it&#039;s throwing you all over the place and especially during withdrawal it&#039;s tough to keep in mind that a lot of the negative thoughts your mind throws up are going to be based on how you feel (i.e. the levels and mix of different chemicals in your brain), NOT on any Real Life Stuff. You&#039;ll most likely unintentionally filter out all the good stuff in your brain and only remember the darkest and worst things you possibly can, and attach all kinds of apparently logical arguments to make a case against yourself / a case that argues that you and your life are awful.\r\nLooking back on this experience, my thoughts were similar to one of those films you see advertised as &quot;...based on a true story&quot;. Works of fiction based very loosely on facts.\r\nRather than a film you&#039;d give two stars and never watch again, emotional reasoning&#039;s end product is a lie - not to mention the most toxic thoughts a human being can think. Depression can definitely make people tell these lies to themselves - but Venlafaxine made my brain malfunction so badly that putting together an apparently sensible argument for any depressive thoughts suddenly seemed like the most obvious thing in the world one day.\r\nIf I hadn&#039;t had those thoughts, I would&#039;ve just made lunch.\r\nSo that&#039;s about it for now - if I don&#039;t update this story in the future, assume I got better and decided to never revisit this page again, preferring to leave Venlafaxine and its horrific toxicity behind me. Good luck with your own journey :)"

The hot flashes disappeared the day I began taking the medication!  My only side effects were a lot of yawning (which lasted about a year).  About 6 months after beginning the medication, the hot flashes began to return (although not as often as before).  My doctor increased the dose and I have been fine for over a year now.

The only issue is,  I went out of town for the weekend I forgot to take my meds with me. I miss 3 days on the medication and the withdrawal symptoms hit me like a ton of bricks. I feel jittery, severe headache, I felt drained, my body felt flu-like. Don&#039;t miss doses!!!"

I thought I was fine and no longer needed to take medication so I weaned myself off in early February however within 2 months I started feeling the way I had been feeling prior to starting treatment.  For months I tried making myself believe that I was just feeling stress and anxiety because of work, but after battling mood swings, distancing myself from my friends and family, drinking and smoking excessively, and being in a seemingly perpetual funk I realized it really wasn&rsquo;t fine and it was time to get my life back.  Last week I started yoga, took a break from alcohol, and went to see a doctor.  He put me back on Celexa and switched me from Xanax to Klonopin.  Today is my first day back on the medication and although I am not thrilled to be back on this type of treatment, I am very much looking forward to feeling &ldquo;normal&rdquo; again.",
                "tweet_1": "I was put on Celexa when I was 19 and I loved it. It made me feel great. Then one day I decided to stop taking my medicines after a few months my depression returned. I have been on 5 or 6 different meds for depression and each time I stopped taking them. I am now 9 months pregnant and my depression, anxiety, and stress where so terrible that my obgyn prescribed me back on to Celexa. I have been taking it for about a week now and already my friends noticed some change in my moods. It&#039;s true at first you will be tired but after a few days of adjusting you will be back to normal. For me the only side effects that I have found that won&#039;t go away are the crazy dreams and sweating while I&#039;m asleep. Other then that I wished I never got off of Celexa.",
                "tweet_2": "I am a 22 year old female, and have been suffering from panic disorder and anticipatory anxiety for about 4 years. But due to a recent event that occurred about a month ago, my panic disorder and anxiety had become CRIPPLING. I could not get through my days without either worrying about a panic attack to the point where I cause one, or not even thinking about the panic attack and having it happen at any random time.It was getting to the point where I was living my days centered around trying to keep myself &quot;level,&quot; but also petrified that I was going to have another attack. I had constant racing thoughts. My doctor recommended an SSRI for me-Celexa (Citalopram). He prescribed 20mg pills. I would take 10mg at night for the first four days, and then after that I would take 20mg at night from then on.   I MADE THE MISTAKE OF RESEARCHING ALL OF THE POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS!!!! I completely understand researching a drug before you take it- but it is important to remember that a lot of people who have positive experiences most often do not write about it. It is the people who have negative experiences who will. I was PETRIFIED to take the drug b/c of the horror stories, until one day I realized that the side effects of the pill were worth it if it meant that I could have peaceful days. I took the first 10mg at night and had (and continue to have) a FANTASTIC sleep. I did not experience ANY nausea, no tightness of chest, no insomnia, no panic, no anxiety, NOTHING but a slight headache. It felt as though the pill gave me relief almost immediately. I have been on the pills for a little over two weeks. They have been a lifesaver for me!! I feel at peace. The racing, flooding thoughts have stopped. The panic attacks have been nonexistent. (My doctor gave me a prescription for Xanax just in case I have one) I feel like myself and I am happy again. I highly recommend trying them if you are suffering from anxiety, panic disorder, or depression."

I will say you have to give it a good month for it to show it&#039;s benefits, and there are side effects in the beginning, but they are minimal and not significant, mostly just yawning and sexual side effects.  Other then that I have found it to be effective. "

Over the next couple of months my dosage was put up to 40 mg and this turned out to be the right dose for me.I specifically just waking up one day and feeling different, like my head was just free from worry and I was thinking happy thoughts.",

You can only imagine my despair. I did however manage to get in and see another doctor. This doctor is my miracle. She prescribed me yaz drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets.

He said to consider Zoloft, because my hormone levels aren&#039;t normal and I have anxiety. I have been spotting everyday for the whole month, and still notice some pain, but not as bad as it was before I started the injections. My obg said this was normal, and assured me after the third injection this would go away. Hopefully it does. I can now say I&#039;m not living in hell 12 times a year."

After the three months  I decided to not try depo again, So I continued to take the pill, but I was still bleeding and spotting. I decided to get off birth control completely and try a new GYN from a different clinic, she said that my body&#039;s menstrual cycle is messed up from Depo, that I only shed my lining a little at a time and its still trying to get out of my system so she put me on Provera to reboot my cycle.

I had taken all 4 of the other prescriptions to stop the bleeding and it never stopped and I&#039;ve been bleeding ever since. I scheduled to have my 3rd shot 1/6/17 and didn&#039;t go!

I started the Depo because I couldn&#039;t remember the pill. Things were going well and then I started a period that lasted for a year. I would have stayed on the Depo regardless of the bleeding, but it was the horrible mood swings that made me stop using it. I was seriously a miserable person. Though this was my experience it could be different for others. My body never reacts the way it should. Really the only way to know is to try it yourself."

My doctor thought I should take birth control again and recommended that I switch to this, so I took a chance.

I was due for another shot in May but I had already made the decision that I would not go back for it because the irregularity of my periods and the fact that I would spot after sex with my boyfriend became too much of a nuisance. After skipping the shot, I bled nonstop until the end of the month. This shot is a headache and I would have been better off without it. I&#039;m just hoping that when my period comes for June it will be back to normal."

I&#039;ve been taking Lexapro 10mg for almost 4 months now and I can confidently say the only scary thing about this medication is people&#039;s negative reviews on it. First and foremost EVERYONE is different, so everyone will react to it differently. I was prescribed it by my primary Doctor due to my severe anxiety and mild depression. Before this medication I was prescribed Celexa, but hated it. My anxiety and depression got so much worse I decided to do something about it. It came to the point where my anxiety and depression affected everyone around me and I just wasn&#039;t happy anymore.  At first taking this medication gave me some side affects. My side effects were really dry mouth, some intense dreams, and some loss of appetite. The only thing that has stuck for these few months have been the dreams. They seems SO REAL! But I can say I rather have some dreams than those scary anxiety attacks I use to get, and those depressed bed sobs. Lexapro has changed my life! Before this medication my life was hitting rock bottom. My Anxiety was so severe it took over my life. I obsessed over everything, overthought everything, felt like at any moment I was going to die. I was on edge every second. My blood pressure was always high and I&#039;m only 24! I had this obsession of dying in a car accident, it came to a point I couldnt ride in a car with anyone else unless I was driving. If I did I would get panic attacks. My depression was also bad and also had an eating disorder. I felt like I was never going to be happy. Was never going to be happy in a relationship, or in my job, or even be able to hug my own mother again. I&#039;m happy the people in my life noticed how much my disorders were taking over my life and helped me make a change. Lexapro helped my life. I hope my review will change yours.",
                "tweet_2": "I just started this medicine 3 days ago and I cannot express how much of an effect it has had on me already. I just graduated high school and became depressed soon after, severe anxiety where I couldn&#039;t go out to eat without having to vomit. I also couldn&#039;t keep focus on anything, especially when trying to talk to people, and overall was in the worst state of my life. Thought I was hopefully, constantly having break downs etc. the doctor prescribed this medicine to me a few months before graduation due to anxiety and overall not feeling myself, I was definitely skeptical and taking medicine in my eyes was a sign of weakness so, I put off the treatment hoping I could cure myself out of this funk. I went to ctb and it helped but it was mainly focused on anxiety. I stopped going because it seemed a waste of my time. Graduation rolls around, my best friends leaves for college really early and my life falls apart. A week was about all I could take of the constant emptiness, headaches and nauseous I got from being so depressed so I decided to start lexapro. The doctor prescribed me 10 mg and the first day I took it (in the morning) I was in a state of euphoria. Just a little background on myself, I was never that outgoing but constantly happy. Never the one to be outgoing in front of strangers and was very conscious of people around me. Not on this pill. I was loopy, could not stop laughing and would not shut up. Although this was great, it did not feel normal and I had very bad dizziness and insomnia that night as the drug began to wear off.. But I wasn&#039;t laying in bed miserably like I did countless nights before, I kind of sat there with a smile so it was actually kind of creepy. That morning I called my physician and asked if this was a normal or okay reaction considering I&#039;ve been told you shouldn&#039;t feel anything for 4-6 weeks. He mentioned that it was &quot;weird&quot; that I had this response but it was a negative one. He recommended I cut my dosage in half and stick with taking 5 kg a day since the 10 obviously overtook my body. Within hours of hanging up I popped half a tablet and can honestly say I felt happy without many side effects. I continued this the following day and my relationship with my boyfriend, family, and friends has greatly improved, I sleep better, I can laugh and actually mean it and I can go in public places without constantly being self conscious. I&#039;ve heard it can have bad results in week 1 and 2 but after taking this medicine for only 3 days, whether it&#039;s the placebo effect or not, has saved me and helped me to return to my normal self."

I also have chronic pain in my back, and I have noticed that the pain which was a level 7 out of 10, is now about a 3. Amazing! That in itself is enough to keep me in a good mood. It was a bit difficult the first 2 months with the side effects and finding a good dose, but it is worth it in the end for sure."

Yes the first two weeks were hard due to nausea and diarrhea however because it controlled the pain I stayed with it. I weaned myself off at one point to make sure whether or not I still needed it but within a week of being completely off of it all the pain and muscle weakness came back so I went back on it (no side effects this time) and the pain went away so it works for me. However the Dr. said that I was his only patient who had the amount of relief I experienced with the lowest dose.  I also have Lupus (SLE) so it helps with the joint and muscle pain there too!! I say give it a try as I experienced the pain relief almost immediate",

The panic attacks subsided almost immediately and the depression lifted. The side effects I experienced (although annoying) were nothing compared to the benefits it gave me. The 1st 2 weeks I was nauseous and tired, felt out of it but my head was clearer and thoughts focused after that. I did lose like 20 pounds, it stopped my emotional eating. The worst part was the night sweats I had for about 2 months or so. I was on it for about 5 months but had to wean off due to lack of insurance. Coming off was terrible though... total withdrawal, brain zaps, confusion etc. I&#039;ll get back on it as soon as I can because I know it did wonders."

I took this medicine after trying to treat it with probiotic and vitamin c ovules to no avail. I did experience very mild nausea and softer stool as expected with antibiotics. By the end of the week wasn&#039;t sure it was 100% gone because After I finished the course of flagyl my period came and I was scared that the bv would come back as other ladies have experienced. Luckily, everything was still back to normal despite my period. So far I&#039;ve been BV free for 3 weeks. It was clear that this infection was causes by sex and not by any internal imbalance so hopefully it will stay away. I learnt my lesson to always always wear condoms because this problem is gross to have. I also now take daily probitotics which is great support for our bodies.

Went back for a culture and and doc said not only did I still have BV but I also had a yeast infection.  Took one Diflucan for the yeast and then started Flagyl again but this time in pill form, not the vaginal gel.  No nausea but weirdly the pills make me feel very lethargic and a little spaced out.

I have limited my dosage of taking this pill (1 pill everyday or every other day) because the side effects are too extreme. I am extremely tired and drowsy and my body feels too weak and distracts me while I am working. However, the smell was gone day two after starting the treatment.

Of course if all else fails I would do it again. \r\n\r\nMy only BV symptom was odor. Doc prescribed me 7 days of Flagyl- 500 mgx2 daily. \r\n\r\nThe drug made my skin hot and flushed internal prickly. I felt lethargic, with little appetite. My mouth felt tingly and I would slur my words; itchy eyes, headaches, rapid heart beat, inability to sleep, loss of personality ..\r\n\r\nBy day 2 of the pills my odor was gone but by day 4 the symptoms of from the pills were almost to bad to finish.  I started taking probiotics on day 5 and it was a complete game changer. All the symptoms were so much better. Plus, it lowers the risk of developing a yeast infection (common side effect of flagyl).\r\n\r\nI take 2 probiotics with each one pill twice daily,  and two probiotics  alone at lunch. I also made sure to drink electrolytes (ie. Coconut water) and eat food with each pill. \r\n\r\nGood luck!"

I was scared to death when reading about the side effects. Other than a headache for a few days... that was all for me. Sooo glad it has changed my life.",

Nothing has had such a positive effect on me as Cymbalta has. I am truly happy for the first time in a long time. I&#039;ve been taking Cymbalta for about 8 months now and I feel great. I have also been diagnosed with Fibromyalgia, which is one reason why my doctor thought Cymbalta would be best. Cymbalta has also helped some with my aches and pains. I have very little side effects with this medicine. I get nauseous once in a while and am tired a lot, but it&#039;s nothing compared to being without Cymbalta. This is by far the best medicine for depression and fibromyalgia."

The 1st 2 weeks I was nauseous and tired, felt out of it but my head was clearer and thoughts focused after that. I did lose like 20 pounds, it stopped my emotional eating. The worst part was the night sweats I had for about 2 months or so. I was on it for about 5 months but had to wean off due to lack of insurance. Coming off was terrible though... total withdrawal, brain zaps, confusion etc. I&#039;ll get back on it as soon as I can because I know it did wonders.",

Yes the first two weeks were hard due to nausea and diarrhea however because it controlled the pain I stayed with it. I weaned myself off at one point to make sure whether or not I still needed it but within a week of being completely off of it all the pain and muscle weakness came back so I went back on it (no side effects this time) and the pain went away so it works for me. However the Dr. said that I was his only patient who had the amount of relief I experienced with the lowest dose.  I also have Lupus (SLE) so it helps with the joint and muscle pain there too!! I say give it a try as I experienced the pain relief almost immediate"

It has been a few years since then and I still had the mostly full bottle with me.

I have been on other meds and had everything, dry mouth, blurred vision, drooling, constipation, you name it, I had it. So Seroquel is at least good for that. The only bad thing in the last 2 years I have noticed over-thinking and like a conversation going on in my head but I cant find a good medicine and I don&#039;t want to increase Seroquel because of the sleepiness"

                "tweet_2": "First a quick rundown, I&#039;m a 44yr old white male with a whole slew of physical problems. Here&#039;s the short list of things hat&#039;s been keeping me awake days at a time.  I have CRPS (2012) ,Degenerative Disk Disease C4 -C7 moderate to severe(2001 since 1.5&quot; shorter). I suffered a T.B.I.( Subdural Laceration .60&quot;) in 2012. Both rotator cuffs that have been torn several times each both of them have SLAP tears and tendonitis ,arthritis in various places. 8 weeks ago I tore my left R.C. for the 3rd or 4th time this time it came with the SLAP tear too. I&#039;ve had issues with not being able to sleep because of pain for the past 5 years, starting shortly after CRPS reared it&#039;s ugly little head. If you aren&#039;t familiar with it just imagine all ten of your toes are broken both feet being beat with a hammer repeatedly accompanied by a little fella with a flamethrower that follows you everywhere you go. This is a 24/7-365,  It made me reconsider my position on voodoo dolls because at times I feel as if I&#039;m being stabbed with an ice pick every 10-15 seconds then after 5-20 pokes it moves to a different joint. Imaginary time over now, on the McGill pain scale it&#039;s the highest rated pain 48/50 childbirth is a 36,cancer 32 many others listed too. The only difference is those pains go away or have treatment options. Recently the surgeon general changed the approved therapy from opioid pain medications to No  Approved Therapies simply because nothing works for more than a couple of months then your body gets use to the nerve blockers and any and all types and dosages of pain meds. Some choose to have thier feet amputated knowing there may still be phantom pain but that&#039;s much lower on the pain scale. Okay now that you know why I&#039;m not sleeping well or at all here is my experience with this RX.  \r\n8 days prior to going to see my Doctor I went to my 1st P.T. session( hurt too much B4 then). During the 2hrs there she pulled and tugged on everything that hurts trying to figure out the range of motion and all that. This was 2 Mondays ago from that day until the following Monday I had slept a total of 9.5 hours going a minimum of 48 hrs between 1.5-2.5 hr naps before the pain would wake me the same as if someone had dumped a bucket of bricks on my head. After a week of this I saw my Dr for my monthly visit and explained everything including how I tried shifting my medications around ,changing the times taken and completely stopping 1 of them for 3 days and another for 2 days with no effect what so ever. He gave me a few choices of medication to try and I choose this one because I&#039;ve never seen a commercial for it on TV. I refuse to take anything that&#039;s advertised on TV. The side effects are usually a more severe of what ever you needed to take it for plus another 20 possible side effects, not 4 me No. I didn&#039;t get home until after 1pm so I planned to take it the next time I felt like I was completely drained and might be able to sleep I would take the RX then as it was the best shot for it to work. That ended up being 10am the next morning,Tuesday.  I took 1-25mg pill 15 minutes before I laid down and I don&#039;t remember my head hitting the pillow. In the past 15 years that has happened maybe 5-8 times. I woke up twice to use the bathroom and take my other meds for pain, less than 5 minutes after getting up to pee I was asleep again. I woke up 5:30 am Wednesday morning and felt more human than I have in the past 5 years. The pain was tolerable enough that I laid there for a couple of more hours. The best sleep I can remember. Since then my shoulder is feeling a little better so it&#039;s not making my normally terrible situation worse and since I&#039;ve learned to deal with it as best as one can I&#039;m getting back to sleeping 3.5 to 4.5 hours every night. I&#039;ve only needed to take 1/2 of one since the first. My situation is very unique but if spilling my guts about things I hate to talk about helps someone else get the sleep they need then it was worth it."

It can be addictive/habit forming, but I have not had this problem with it. \r\r\n\r\r\nUsually takes about 20 - 30 mins. for it to work for me and then I feel just fine.",

I don&#039;t take it that often, I take it as needed and usually only need 1/2 of one to get stop the panic attack, on rare occasion I take 1 whole if it&#039;s a really bad one but that isn&#039;t very often at all seems though I can stop them before they get extreme. It works GREAT for me, with no side effects at all. And even after being on them for such a long period of time, I&#039;ve not had to up my dose ever. I still take the same amount I started with (as needed). This was a lifesaver for me, as I was too anxious to even take meds before them. I feel safe now and know that this will work. Recommend!",
                "tweet_2": "For generalized anxiety, this medication is probably the best or second best out there for it. It helps tremendously with general anxiety. When it comes to panic disorder, I would say it has its pros and cons but overall is good. If you only take Clonazepam for panic attacks, and that&#039;s the only time you take it, it should be great. (And was for me!) If you take it daily to prevent panic attacks, I think it also works great. But if you take it daily to prevent but end up still getting one, it doesn&#039;t help too much. But it&#039;s one of the better benzos to take as a regimen (though there is no* such thing as a good regimen) but it has its peak effect at around 2-3 hours and can last long, making it a great reliever for many! It&#039;s helped me!"

I also used it for longer sleep as needed for a special event such as traveling out of town.  Finally I was sent for a sleep study last month and found that I have severe sleep apnea while sleeping on my back and mild on my side.

My doctor gave me clonazepam or rivotril here in the phillipines.. First I take 2mg, 1mg and 0.5mg as of now.  I take it in the morning when I needed it for anxiety panic attacks and add another .5mg if my attacks was strong. I take .5mg everynight for sleep since march last year.

Thinking to myself I wonder what the molecular structure of that plaster looks like.  So I asked to try something more anxiety based and less sleep aid based.  I have been taking it periodically when required for the past 10 years with breaks in between.  2 mg will knock me out hard but 1-1.5 mg is a pretty good dose to just relax me.  I&#039;ve never been very dependent, no withdrawals, and I have never built up a tolerance to it.",

I also went through the worst withdrawal trying to get off of this and I am still unable to sleep since using it. I think it affected my brain&#039;s chemistry. I literally only sleep 5 to 6 hours a week since quitting.

I have severe insomnia and only take at night time.  Never during day.  I have never built up a tolerance to this.  When I go without,... even for 5 months once, zero withdrawals!  Zero side effect.  However I go back to bad sleep, which I had before.  Never been dependent, as you can tell I can go without....for months.

The insertion was definitely painful but nothing that can&#039;t be handled in the 5-10 minutes the procedure takes. I had read a lot of scare stories previous to going. I unfortunately had mine inserted a week before my period. The cervix softens during your period which is the recommended time to have it done. I spotted with little to no cramping for the first 2- 3 days and got my period a couple days later as well. I had some pretty severe cramps on and off the first day or so into my period. It almost feels as though your body is trying to contract it out. My period lasted a little longer but has stopped with no spotting at all.",

I was in about 6/10 pain for a few hours after because i took ibuprofen as my Dr recommended, but tylenol is usually what works for me so after I took some the pain decreased significantly. I was able to go to work afterwards and now my periods are lighter and MUCH shorter than before. I would recommend an IUD to anyone looking for a long-lasting bc method.",

Surprisingly my last period happened right on schedule. I was on the pill for 5 years prior to Skyla and had never really had cramps due to that. Now that I&#039;m not taking the pill my period cramps have been intense but I doubt it&#039;s due to the IUD. Other than the normal that-time-of-the-month cramps and bleeding, I&#039;ve had neither spotting or random cramping. I would definitely recommend Skyla."

I liked the idea of the IUD because I didn&#039;t have to remember to take it, it was there for three years, it was the most effective, and because there was an option to have an IUD without hormones. I struggle with depression and anxiety and I was afraid that hormonal birth control would only make matters worse. However, because of all of the terrible period stories I had heard about it, at the last minute I had my OBGYN switch to Skyla. The insertion did not take long at all and amid horror stories, the pain wasn&#039;t unbearable. It didn&#039;t feel great, but it was well worth it. If the fear of insertion is what drives you away from this option, don&#039;t let that happen! Before my IUD my periods were like clockwork, every four weeks, five days, no cramps- perfect. Afterward, I still don&#039;t get cramps, some periods have been really light, but I have had a period that was over a week late and one that was two weeks long. This is to be expected in the first few months. I do not believe that it has had any influence on my depression/anxiety, at least not monumental. I haven&#039;t gained weight, lost my sex drive or any other negative symptoms. My partner has finished inside of me multiple times and nothing has happened. Also, he cannot feel the strings. I would highly recommend this form of birth control, I understand every body is different, but if you&#039;re spending hours reading horror stories like I was, don&#039;t let that stop you."

My period was longer (but lighter) for the first 6 months, but now I just spot for a couple of days every other month, which is fantastic.

The pros are that you don&#039;t have to worry for pregnancy or taking a pill daily and also it is one of the most effective birth control methods. The cons are that I was bleeding for almost 2 months when I got it inserted. After that I have had my regular period lasting about 2 more day than before (I&#039;m very regular though). The pain when I got it inserted wasn&#039;t that bad, it just lasted about 1 minute and for the cramps I just had a couple tylenols and that was just enough. I would recommend it for women that are 100% sure that they don&#039;t want to get pregnant for sure for at least 3 years and only if you have one partner. It is worth it.

Why? Because people are twice as likely to write a review if they had a bad experience; it&#039;s sort of like the media- it is twice as likely to cover a story if it&#039;s really bad. So don&#039;t let these reviews scare you! IUD placement should be a personal choice. You should go to a doctor that you trust, and they will assess your uterus, its size and shape as well as your cervix to see if an IUD will be compatible. They will know if your uterus is too small or if you cannot tolerate the procedure. \r\nMy NP made me feel comfortable and relaxed when she inserted my Skyla IUD, and overall it wasn&#039;t bad at all! It&#039;s going to hurt, but it&#039;s over quickly and if you deep breathe (but do not hyperventilate) and distract your thoughts it&#039;s over before you know it. After the insertion I took 800mg ibuprofen and was on my way to school. I didn&#039;t feel a thing for a few hours until later that night I experienced some mild cramping. Overall I&#039;m really glad I made the decision to get the Skyla. I&#039;m a fan of birth control with the least amount of hormones possible so that my body can still balance and regulate its own hormones. Skyla has a localized effect so that you don&#039;t get many of the systemic side effects of the pill. \r\nIt only took a couple of days for me to feel great and barely notice the IUD! Now I don&#039;t feel it at all."

The first time we tried, my cervix wouldn&#039;t dilate enough to be placed, so I had to see another dr that injected my cervix with a drug that dilated my cervix  enough. It was very painful for me. I felt 3 or four sharp pinches and the usually bad period cramps. For the first 15 minutes after I was so light headed that I had to put cold water on my face and sit down. Had bad period cramps and light spotting for the rest of the day. Still have some spotting and cramping 5 days later. I haven&#039;t had sex since so can&#039;t comment on how effective it is, but wanted to give me experience with insertion. Although it was rough for me, I would suggest it to anyone that wants long term bc",

After reading all the reviews on here I was scared to death. I went in and they did a normal pelvic exam, and then started.  The insertion was NOT as bad as all of the comments. There was a lot of pressure, and 1 small pinch, from the clamp they use to keep your cervix open. The only painful part for me was trying to open the cervix. They had to take several tries to get up there. The pain is like a severe period cramp. That&#039;s all. It wasn&#039;t the worst pain ever for me, very bearable! It&#039;s been about 6 hours since the insertion and I have no cramps, and a small amount of sporting. It wasn&#039;t bad at all!",

It wasn&#039;t painful, but it was slight discomfort and I felt a little light headed like I was about to pass out. I think it was from whatever he put in my cervix to numb it. I went home fine but later that night I had the worst cramps, I thought I was going to die. But after that night I was fine until 3 days later I got more bad cramps I couldn&#039;t even go to work. But it went away shortly. It&#039;s been past 7 days of being on my period and I&#039;m still bleeding but it&#039;s light . i didn&#039;t rate a 10 because I have to  see how this go for another couple months"

When I first got it inserted I cramped and bleed for 2 months straight. I went back in for checkups during those two months and the doctor said it was normal. And that my body was just adjusting. The bleeding stopped after the 3rd month, but started back immediately after having sex.  And from that point on it was a constant cycle or stopping, sex, bleeding back on. I would say out of an entire month I only had like 10 days (if that) of not bleeding. My cycles were not heavy, and I didn&#039;t really experience any cramps, but bleeding constantly gets to be annoying. I would probably not get a new one inserted after my 3 years is over.",

My period has gotten lighter as the months pass. I still get my period but I&#039;ll get it for about 1.5-2 weeks with only 1 heavy day and then all the other days are light. But the bonus is I won&#039;t get my period for 2 months after that. I don&#039;t get cramping nearly as much anymore maybe once or twice in a few months. Every once in a while I feel like I can feel,it inside me which is weird but it only last for a minute. I will be getting the skyla again once this one needs to be replaced! I love it!",

My periods now are much lighter than before.. spotting for the first two days, then two days of regular bleeding, and then another 2 to three days of spotting. I love that I don&#039;t have to worry now about birth control and even if i forget that it&#039;s that time of the month, the flow is so manageable that even when it comes unsuspectingly, its not a big mess. I love not having to worry about birth control and its making my periods shorter and lighter."

I am a person who has struggled with horrible mood swings, cystic acne, heavy crampy periods, and no luck with any other BC and I have tried nearly all of them in the 11 years I have been on BC.

I&#039;m not pregnant, which I most definitely would be if this wasn&#039;t effective. About 7 months into having my skyla I have developed extremely bad cystic acne, to the point where I can see the scars becoming holes on my cheeks. For me, that has been the only downside and is making me contemplate removing it, as cystic acne scarring is permanent.",

Cons I got super depressed the first 3 months of being on it, I never had acne until now and it&rsquo;s embarrassing it&rsquo;s cystic acne and I have acne scars and no acne meds help, I have my period on an off for 2 weeks out of the month, I snap a lot at my husband, hair loss the first 4 months on it, and now I have intense back pain to the point I can&rsquo;t sit or stand.

Before going to the appointment I took 800mg ibuprofen and when I arrived I took 400mg of ibuprofen. After it was inserted i had small cramping. No even on the level my period cramping is on. the only thing bothering me is the back pain so far. Some days I have spotting, others nothing at all. I honestly forget I have Skyla in"

My Doctor was awesome and walked through every step with me and it was about 3 cramps (one slight, medium, and severe cramp) and it was over in less than a minute. Yes I got dizzy which is common but they gave me juice and had me wait about 5 minutes and I was able to drive myself home just fine. Cramping afterwards is painful but it has gotten better and so far this is the best birth control I have tried.",

The day before I had my insertion I read this whole page of reviews and really psyched myself out about how painful it would be to be put it in. Yes, it was very painful during and quite uncomfortable the rest of the day of (I would recommend a day off from work that day). I bled a bit and avoided sex due to it being uncomfortable for a few weeks, after that it was totally fine and my boyfriend couldn&#039;t even tell it was there. Again, if you&#039;re on the fence about this I highly recommend it. Although painful and a little annoying at first I&#039;m now 8 months in and as long as I&#039;m interested in birth control I&#039;ll never go back to anything else!",

There is no daily pill, no monthly shot appointments, just one day of insertion and then you are good to go for three years. Yes, insertion is painful. It wasn&#039;t miserable, but it&#039;s uncomfortable and you will need at least a day of rest and recovery. I was not on my period at the time of my insertion, so that might have caused a little more pain also. This is my first form of birth control and I have not had kids or been pregnant. The worst side effects are that it will increase your cramps and menstrual pain, but it will get better over a few months. And it will change your period cycle, though it depends on your body!"

She has been issuing Mirena for over ten years and has never had an ectopic pregnancy.  In the pass few years of inserting skyla she has seen FIVE ectopic pregnancies in women.

I have been in and out of the doctors office for the removal of Skyla, blood tests, and ultrasounds. As well as an ER visit due to the possibility of an ectopic pregnancy. I did not want this pregnancy and I&#039;ve been put through hell because Skyla did not work. I don&#039;t recommend it to anyone."

My first period was longer than usual (7 days, is normally 4), but the bleeding was much lighter (no clots or excessively heavy bleeding).

I took Advil half an hour before the procedure and had very little cramping after. Started spotting 3 days later for about a week and it has not gone away. Have already had sex with my husband and he only felt the strings the first time but since then he has not it.

Over the years the symptoms have lessened, but some days it is just hard to get up - pain, achy, foggy headed.  I tried the Tramadol and it killed the pain almost immediately plus it had an unexpected extra bonus.  I have had a lot of foot pain for many years and sometimes could barely hobble around - the pain was gone.  I could actually put on shoes and not be in misery.  I&#039;m going to London in a few weeks and now don&#039;t worry about the tours and being in pain.  This medicine is my lifesaver.

After all that time, I am now on the maximum dose per day and I know I am physically dependent.  But it is still the only medication that I can take long term that takes the edge off my fibro pain enough for me to function and work full time.  I have also developed osteoarthritis and it helps with that, too.  The only NSAID I can tolerate is naproxen."

I had not felt much relief in my depression and anxiety on 50mg so my psych doc put me on 100mg after two weeks.  I am on day 4 taking 100mg sertraline and have already started to notice a difference in my mood.  I am less anxious and worry much less at work.  I am also beginning to venture out of the house more than I used to.  The only side effects I&#039;ve had on sertraline are mild headache, diarrhea, and decrease in sexual performance.",

It not only helped my social anxiety but also reduced my general anxiety too stretching out my Xanax for when I really needed it the most.

I stayed on strong with hope and 2 days ago I woke up feeling like my old self! I had a lot of energy, I did not have any anxiety at all, the racing thoughts in my head were gone to the point where I felt awesome! My old self is back within 2 weeks because of Zoloft. If you are concerned about this medicine, try it for at least a month if not longer, it gave me great results so far with no side effects, and it can do the same for you."

I took Lexapro for 3 months prior to Setraline, but it didn&#039;t help me much (actually caused more depression).  It took about 3-4 weeks for me to fully see the benefits of this drug, however it causes bluntness to my good feelings and extreme fatigue.  It is very hard for me to function like this as I am a mother of 3 and need that energy/motivation to get around and not just want to lay in bed all day.  I would rate it 7 with my OCD, 9 for anxiety and depression."

I&#039;ve always battled anxiety and panic attacks, and was on a small dose of Paxil and that seemed to take the edge off. I took it on and off for years. After I had my second baby at 28, I got terrible postpartum depression. I had thoughts of suicide, racing thought constantly, couldn&#039;t nap and took forever to fall asleep at night. I literally spent three months just thinking and obsessing over how horrible I felt. I wanted to crawl out of my skin and die. I was barely showering, brushing my teeth and hair and would stay in the same sweatpants and shirt for days. I could go on forever by I&#039;ll get to the point. After three months of pure hell, I went to my doctor for help. I was prescribed 50 ML of Zoloft. After being on it for 4 weeks, I stopped taking it because it wasn&#039;t working. After going another 2 weeks feeling miserable, I went to my doctor again.  She recommended we up the dose and stay on it for atleast 6 weeks. Well, after two weeks on 100 ML, I realized I was feeling better. I would go minutes without thinking negatively, then I would go hours, then full days. It feels SO good to feel like myself again. I truly thought I would be miserable forever. Please get help and try something if you are feeling terrible. Everyone is curable with the right drug and right dose. I wish I got help sooner. TRY THIS! It will work! If for some reason it doesn&#039;t, try something else! GET HELP NOW! I was doing the same thing you are - googling all types of antidepressants convinced there was no cure and they would never work. Stop spending your life wondering when you will be yourself again. You WILL get better and be 100% your old self again with an antidepressant!",
                "tweet_1": "I started taking this medicine when I was 16.  I am 26 now.  Right now I take 100mgs.  I was an unhappy teenager and I can&#039;t say it did anything for me at that point in my life (but I was only taking 50mgs then).  I stayed on Zoloft all through college and only went off of it for about 6 months, at the urging of a boyfriend at the time.  Those months were bad.  I tried everything to feel better (exercise, meditation, different activities) but I always felt like there was blackness hanging over everything.  I couldn&#039;t function socially and became rather reclusive.  With the help of my therapist and psychiatrist, I went back on Zoloft and my depressive symptoms decreased dramatically.  I have been on Zoloft for 10 years now so it&#039;s just a part of my life.  I get sad sometimes, but when I get hopeless feelings I can process them more easily.  It&#039;s hard for me to imagine life without Zoloft, but I hope to someday regulate my depression with a therapist and go off of it.  That said, I don&#039;t really have any side-effects to speak of.  Sometimes I have a low sex drive, but its only at certain times of the month, like before my period.  However, having a diminished sex drive on antidepressants is easier than not having any drive whatsoever when you are off them. To me, taking Zoloft is almost like taking a vitamin. It&#039;s no big deal.",

My life overall is normal and I managed the episodes but I always knew they were there and didn&#039;t like feeling that way. I am married we have children combine that with everything else and it times it was just too much. The doctor suggested the Zoloft.  I was nervous at first and really didn&#039;t know what to expect. In fact I waited a month or two to even fill the prescription. The side effects  we&#039;re obvious at first. Dizziness, tired, minor confusion. I don&#039;t want to scare anyone because I still functioned , Still was able to work, I was able to take care of the kids,  everything was pretty much normal but I could tell my mind was a bit off.     \r\nAfter about a month the side effects faded away from me. After two months my mind became clear and my attitude towards life improved dramatically. Little things didn&#039;t bother me anymore. I started working out and that didn&#039;t bother me anymore. My wife would argue with me about normal marriage stuff but I wouldn&#039;t yell back. In fact I was able to see how foolish most of the fighting was and how pointless it was to yell back. My work life improved. My conversations with other people improved. I found myself more interested in what the person was saying and focusing more on what they were saying.\r\nAt a follow up visit with my doctor he asked if I&#039;d like to stay on the medication. I told him that my life has never been better and my mind never more clear so why would I choose to stop. He agreed and was happy with my progress. He initially prescribed 100 mg but I found 50 works well for me at this point. So every night before bed I take my pill and wake up the next morning feeling ready to go instead of wanting to stay in bed. \r\nFor those just starting or thinking about starting this medication I can honestly tell you it has changed my life for the better. Initially it was rough but after a while all that fades and your left feeling really good. For me it took about two months for others it may take longer or shorter.  \r\nI hopes this helps as I read a lot about this medication prior to starting and found a lot of the write ups were negative. I honestly think those people may have other issues or conditions that this medication can&#039;t help or they may have not been able to get through the initial break in period."

I have had to up my dosage to 50mg during times of high stress and it has helped so much. The only side effects I have experienced were a little nausea, some apathy, and insomnia. Other than that, I have tolerated this medication very well. It helps me put things into perspective and stops me from my having such negative, anxiety ridden thinking patterns.

My anxiety has been debilitating since my Multiple Sclerosis diagnosis in October of 2015. It became so bad that I was becoming bed ridden, afraid to leave my home. As a mother of 3 and a wife and daughter, my family needed me and I wasn&#039;t able to be there. I finally told my husband and parents I needed to seek help. After a therapy session and a visit with my family doctor I was given Zoloft. I received it on a Tuesday but was so afraid to take it, I didn&#039;t take my first one until Friday (I had read a few bad drug reviews, so I knew some things I could expect, but chose to focus on all the success stories for motivation.) For three weeks it was rough. Also must note, during this time we were hit with hurricane Matthew which didn&#039;t help and I believe set me back a few days. My side effects were tummy aches, diarrhea (sometimes 4 or 5 times a day), a few hot flashes, a couple days of zombie feeling, and I had 2 bad panic attacks. I know this sounds horrible, however, my opinion is that I felt as though I had hit rock bottom which is why I turned to medication. I already felt bad, so my commitment was to see this medicine through to the 4-6 week mark as instructed. If I had stopped taking it, I still would have felt horrible, that is what my life had become. With the wonderful support of my children and husband, a lot of take out food, and my parents helping to take and pick up my kids from school, I am SOOOOOO thankful I stuck with it and made it to the 4 week mark. I feel like I&#039;m getting my life back. It is worth everything you go through. In full disclosure, some people get no side effects... my 20 year old son has been on Zoloft for a year and never had one side effect. I wasn&#039;t that lucky and seemed to have most. Please give yourself the chance. You will read over and over again to stick with it until 4-6 weeks... you must do yourself that favor. Surround yourself with support if you can and just do it! I&#039;m so blessed to have my life back!!!!!"

Although my OCD does come back from time to time, it is no where nearly as bad now compared to how it used to be. The repetitive thoughts have decreased by about 80% and that is more then I can ever ask for.

When I was on 100 mg (my doctor didn&#039;t believe this was a side effect of the medicines (but I am CERTAIN), so I backed myself down to 75 mg and after 2 weeks of being on that reduced dosage the jaw clenching went away. SO grateful for this medicine. VERY IMPORTANT- if you have anxiety, panic, or depression. GET COUNSELING- it helps almost as much as the medicine."

Thank God for this medicine and the improvements that it makes on the brain chemistry. Only experienced diarrhea for 1 day (which was okay for me because I&#039;ve always struggled with constipation which only contributed to fatigue and depression). I&#039;m more social (before I didn&#039;t care about doing much, even though I wanted to go out, when it came time to, I would end up going to bed), more easy going, less irritable and cranky. So much more patient with my kids. No side effects for me. Oh and I&#039;m not eating ravenously at night because of stress and anxiety like I used to so it&#039;s helping me lose weight. Yay!",

I was afraid of driving, going to work, being with friends, almost anything made me experience horrible physical sensations. In September 2014 I was prescribed prozac this increased my anxiety so was given an anti psychotic which worked but I did not feel anything I felt like a zombie. 5 weeks into taking sertraline I haven&#039;t had a panic attack since the first week and when I do get anxiety it goes away quickly and is much less intense. It has given me my confidence back and lifted my mood. For anyone suffering with panic disorder I would recommend giving this a try. I&#039;m on 50mg  a day.",

Been on it for almost 3 months and it has made a huge difference. I feel happier around my coworkers and around people. I haven&#039;t felt weird and uncomfortable or had any bad panic attacks. I&#039;m on 25mg and feel in control of my life. I&#039;m finally feeling normal thanks to this medicine so far. I&#039;ll stick with this dose for awhile and see how it goes. Side effects very little like shaky when I wake up. But I love it so far."

I tried to get over it by myself but I couldn&#039;t do it so I went for it and the first day I took Zoloft I noticed a difference (usually it takes a few weeks) the only side effects that I noticed was that I cannot sleep like I used to. If you are thinking about trying Zoloft make sure its a good idea for you, talk to your doctor and be sure to get as much info as possible and remember we are all different. You may or may not have any side effects, but it doesn&#039;t hurt to try. Good luck.",

Went to therapy and after some time Dr Recommended Zoloft. Was hesitant at first but could not live like this anymore so I started taking it about a year ago. Zoloft is the best thing I could have done. The first week or too I had side effects. But soon after depression lifted anxiety gone. I sleep great now."

I was worried that it might cause weight gain and that there may be sexual side effects.  I was on this medication for 2 years and DID NOT experience weight gain or sexual side effects.  The first few months I was on it I had some stomach upset and trouble sleeping but that disappeared shortly after.  I have maintained a consistent body weight (within 5 lbs.) for years and zoloft did not seem to affect my weight at all.  I lost a few pounds at first because of the stomach upset"

By the third, I was a basket case. This is also when the weight gain kicked in - I gained almost 15 lbs in 5-6 weeks. If I wasn&#039;t depressed before, this definitely did the trick. My Doctor then took me off the Yaz/Zoloft regimen and opted to stop my periods altogether, to stop the monthly hormone fluctuation. I have been on Seasonique for three months and it has been amazing!

It has been absolutely wonderful! The first couple of days I took the whole 25 mg in the morning. I found this to give me headaches and tremors. So I decided to split the pill in 2 pieces and take half in the morning and half with lunch. I only had to do this for about a week; I now take the whole 25 mg in the morning, with or without food, no problems. No serious side effects, definitely not enough to outweigh the benefits. Zoloft has absolutely given me my life back! I was afraid to take it, especially after all of the negative reviews, but I am so happy I gave it a try. Wonderful!"

It did help, but this time not nearly as much. It lifted my mood and helped me have less mood swings. It barely touched my anxiety and agoraphobia, plus this time around the sexual side effects were devastating. The effort it took to have an orgasm was unbelievable! Even at a dose of only 50mg."

Some other side-effects have been dry mouth, anxiety in the mornings, more agitation, and an increase in anxiety-soothing habits (such as picking, scratching, obsessing over flaws, etc).

As a first time mom I thought everything I was experiencing was typical, until I began having suicidal thoughts and resorted to self harm all taking a toll on my relationship with my son and husband. Waited until my son was 10 months old to finally get help. I felt severe anxiety still while taking Zoloft. Again this is only my experience with this medication."

The reason being that nothing (not even this medicine) will help you quit if you don&#039;t really want to. I do. I&#039;ve been on it for three weeks, quit for two. During the first week, I smoked, but I noticed my urge to smoke decreased a lot. Side effects: mild nausea (take it with food) and that&#039;s about it. I still get cravings, but the part of me that wants to quit is now stronger. I know I have Chantix to thank for that. If you&#039;re ready to quit, try this.",

I have now not smoked in over four months.  For me, taking this pill just slowly reduced my cravings.  I can tell you that I was off a little bit, nothing I could put my finger on just off...like a bit slow.  I had weird dreams and was crabbier too. Due to these side effects, after I stopped smoking I took the pill for another month and stopped chantix too.

Within the first 3 weeks I was able to cut down from a pack a day to 2-3 cigarettes a day. After the third week I smoked the last cigarette I had and told myself I was not going to spend money on them anymore. And I haven&#039;t had any since. It was hard; I honestly enjoyed smoking; but as each day went by as a non smoker I was more fearful that if I had even a puff I would go back to smoking and all this fight to quit would be wasted."

I stopped smoking on the day I started taking it and I think this makes a difference, everyone I have spoken to who has continued to smoke for a week or two before their quit date has suffererd side effects, my friends and myself who quit on the day they started taking Champix have had no side effects. My Dr advised me not to smoke at all on this medication as this will increase the side effects not sure if it&#039;s true for all but definately for the people I know who have done it this way."

Even on my good days where I wasn&#039;t anxious, I just didn&#039;t have the motivation to do anything. I really don&#039;t recommend this to anyone. But if it helps you, that&#039;s good."

My month on fluoxetine I didn&#039;t feel a change and had nothing but side effects from flu like symptoms to headaches. I&#039;ve been on it now for 4 months and this is the best medicine I&#039;ve ever been on. My anxiety is gone, most of the depression is gone.

I&#039;ve been on it about 10 weeks now and I feel pretty great! I still get anxiety but nothing compared to what I had before. I&#039;m also generally happier. My only complaints are that I don&#039;t sleep as well. I take the fluoxetine in the morning but still find myself waking up through the night which makes me very tired during the day.

I started feeling the effects about 2 1/2 weeks in. The daily pangs of anxiety are gone, and I feel so much better already. I am so glad I went to the Dr. and so thankful for this medication. I can describe the feeling as normal, and relieved. The side effects I have experienced have been headache while taking it on an empty stomach. Besides that, I have absolutely no complaints."

I&#039;ve tried many different antidepressants in the past with no luck, so I had low hopes that this would help. \r\nI&#039;m so glad I tried this! I&#039;ve been on this for five weeks and the only side effects are it takes me longer to have an orgasm, and my blood pressure is slightly lower.

In the end i kept a diary. For 2 weeks of each month i would be fine followed by around 10 days of feeling low, irritable, moody, anxious etc.  I did increase the dose to 40mg daily at one point but kept getting bruises on my thighs and itchy legs (side effect) so reduced it back to 20mg. I would definitely recommend this to anyone else suffering from PMDD.",

Excessive drowsiness, nausea, increased anxiety especially in the morning, diarrhea, completely lost my appetite. Well I&#039;m glad I hung in there because the side effects went away, my mood improved tremendously, and on top of that I lost 20 lbs in the first 1.5 months. My appetite has improved. Very happy about the weight loss, but I feel that 20mg would be a little more effective in treating PMDD symptoms. Overall its great."

Over the years I have tried so many medications, but Prozac is the first to really assist. I started on 20mg, which has recently increased to 40mg. This is the only medicine/therapy that has dramatically decreased my impulse to binge/purge. I am feeling so happy within myself and it has really assisted with my depression and low energy levels too. One odd side effect I have noted is that I am yawning a lot, a small price to pay to being in control of my eating and mood. This is definitely worth a try if you are having bulimic symptoms and recommend it highly. Good luck.",

My husband does not like the change in personality I have had while on it.  He doesn&#039;t know about my disorder.  While on the medicine my bulimia was greatly reduced, but I did binge and purge still on occasion.  Felt a greater sense of self control though.  Since quitting the medicine about a week ago, I have been out of control, binging and purging twice a day on average.  I think I need to start taking it again, placebo effect or not.",

Haven&#039;t had the need to binge/purge in 5 days and my appetite has decreased to where I only eat the regular 3 meals/day. Because of this I&#039;ve actually LOST 3lbs. Also I&#039;m more motivated to do things now with this medicine. I&#039;m very happy with this medication so far. Only negative is I&#039;ve noticed it&#039;s been harder to go to the bathroom.

Now I am finding that the effectiveness is not as good even with the higher dose.  Has anyone else found this to be true.

My blood sugars have been in the average of 140s 2 hours after I eat and feel great!  I hope this keeps up because it does help me with the weight loss issue as well as my type 2 diabetes!  When I first was on Victoza I had really bad headaches and nausea and some diarrhea.  But that lasted about a month to month and a half and since then I have not had any issues with side effects. Greatly recommended prescription for those who have tried everything under the sun to keep sugar in control and the only possible next step was going to be insulin.

Don&#039;t get me wrong, it works, you&#039;ll just be battling the fires of hell of your vagina most of the day. I used the 1 day last night and all was good. I went to bed and slept for 5 peaceful hours. The pain actually woke me up, intense burning and really swollen. Took a bath and felt a little better. About 1 hr later intense pain and the little bottle of devils cream they give you sucks . I researched home remedies for burning and found applying yogurt helps. Desperate and in agony I found myself spooning yogurt on my lady parts. It did bring relief but only for a bit. Swollen and burning I decided to try ice. Get a bowl of ice and find somewhere to lay down and relax, you are going to need to be relaxed for this. I gradually iced it... At first the only thing I could do was remind myself to breath. Honestly, it&#039;s sucks, but it feels really good when you go numb. It was absolutely worth the first 5 mins. I noticed my swelling go down and my pain eased significantly. Monistat 1 is very effective but it depends if you want a fire vagina for part of the day. I&#039;m still torn if I&#039;ll ever use it again.

I keep in mind tomorrow it will be all worth it. So far Great medicine , itching is gone already and it&#039;s 1130p",

This is only the second time I had a YI and last time I used the montistat 3 day medicine which was ok. So when I saw that I could take the medicine all at once I thought it would b a better experience. I was sooo WRONG! I inserted the medicine around 10 pm and went to bed hoping that I would wake up with it gone instead at 3 am I woke up with the worst burning and itching I ever felt in my life!! The pain was so unbearable for several hours until I came across someone&#039;s post who suggested advil to help the swelling. So at around 8 am I took advil and put ice  by 10:30 am I feel so much better"

I decided to try monistat-1 because I am insurance less at the moment and figured it would be cheaper. 10 to 15 minutes after inserting the egg I was in heaven. I actually took it in the evening around 6pm and stayed in bed reading all night. When I finally went to sleep, and woke up about 7am, it was like I never took the meds at all. Applied a little of the cream it came with and I&#039;m back to a dull roar. I definitely feel better, but I am hoping that the itching stops completely by work time tomorrow.

I didn&#039;t want to take more time off of work to go back to the doctors and I wanted relief, and fast. Among the bad reviews there were still good ones so I listened to those instead and just went for it with the Monistat1 Ovule. The itching ended up getting worse at first but then went away and completely and the next day I was completely fine. This stuff is magic! Suck it up buttercup and just do it"

Luckily I had this forum to ensure me that other women experienced the same, so I tried to just sleep it off. In the morning the itching and burning had DEFINITELY gone down, I was so relieved. The box says even though it&#039;s one dose, it still take a few days to completely clear up. Each day has felt progressively better. It&#039;s now Saturday and I feel pretty much back to normal, with a few little itches here and there, but only if i&#039;m really focusing on it. Hopefully by tomorrow it should be completely gone!"

I don&#039;t understand what&#039;s going on but I do know this did NOT help me at all! This medication made my (MILD SYMPTOMS WORSE)!!! Please DO NOT USE AT ALL!!!!!!

BUT here is my NUGGET OF ADVICE...after about an hour of torture, I sat in a warm bath mixed with about a half cup of apple cider vinegar, and felt instant relief. After about 20 minutes of that, I wrapped up some ice and sat on it for another 30 minutes. I&#039;m now feeling 85% better, no itching but a dull burning sensation, and it&#039;s been almost three hours since I first inserted the ovule. Hoping it works out, fingers crossed. Good luck, ladies!! Will definitely use the 3-day pack next time."

Apparently this cream is the detonator. Cue the most severe burning, itching, and tingling of my life. Scooped out what I could with a cold towel. Also, do NOT get any on your back end hole because that will burn too. Currently cooling off in front of my  fan. Never again."

This could be a result of me not placing the ovule as far in as it could go because I was in a rush and did not read the directions but as soon as the egg started to melt I felt an intense burning on my entire vagina (inside and out).

(Thankfully) it&#039;s now the next day and I feel nothing more than a cooling sensation down there.  I didn&#039;t experience any burning but just a small amount of itching a couple hours after using Monistat which was nothing I couldn&#039;t handle.  It seems to really be doing what it&#039;s intended to do. This is my first YI and overall I&#039;m very pleased with the results from using Monistat 1."

In contradiction to what I had read from other online reviews. I did NOT have ANY burning or itching after insert. In fact, I felt relief within the first 20 minutes after inserting it and the relief continued the following days.

They have upped my dose.\r\nBut at this point Xanax is a life saver and I don&#039;t know what I would do without them. The only draw back is the half life they wear off to soon and I will not take another dose until time to take it again, those few hours are not good. But 2 and 1/2 milligrams a day is far as I will take this. I have been on benzodiazepines for three years and that scares me, but not like the panic attack, those make you feel like your having a heart-attack or worse. I have had some that I really did not think I was going to live through.\r\nSo my Xanax stays until I can get off them when the stress is gone and a taper off, never suddenly go off them it could be very dangerous.

I was afraid of getting addicted to it but I only take a small dose and don&#039;t take it everyday.  When I don&#039;t take it, the tinnitus is pretty bad.  I don&#039;t know if it is because the anxiety is so bad and it helps that but it certainly reduces the volume of the tinnitus."

If you are taking it in hopes that your daily aches and pains are going to go away then I suggest you see a different doctor and try something else. I take Savella also and that has helped me a great deal. But I am using amitriptyline because I suffer from tension headaches and migraines. Out of the month, I can go every day with a headache. I have not been on it long enough to give you a full review but since I have been on it I can say that I am sleeping much better and my headaches are getting better.

So I&#039;ve had to choose to not take it and live with the pain and constant peeing because I cannot afford to gain any weight due the diabetes.  I&#039;m basically distraught.

Not really a complaint it was needed weight. However in the last year or so I have noticed a change in my behavior and sex drive. I&#039;m worried this bc has something to do with it.

I missed so much school because of how intense my pain was. I&#039;ve been on the pill now for almost 7 months, and it has helped tremendously. I have not had ANY cramps at all. My period was also very irregular before I started the pill, and since I&#039;ve started taking this, I do not even have a period!

Right now I have almost no acne and just tiny blemishes. Pretty amazing to me since I&#039;ve always had acne problems. As for the spotting, I no longer am getting it, so that&#039;s good.

I am now seventeen. I dealt with being &#039;sick&#039; 3-5 days a month. After conducting some research, &amp; asking around, many people advised birth control was the way to go. I finally gathered up the courage &amp; collected my nerves &amp; went to the doctor for a solution. \r\n\r\nAt sixteen, a magic pill that made everything about your period better seemed like a pretty sweet deal to me. I didn&#039;t even hesitate to grab the trial sample from my doctors hand. I was excited to be rid of what was a seemingly huge issue at the time. \r\n\r\nThe first month was absolute hell. I cried at the drop of a hat the entire month. I got extremely depressed &amp; anxious. I bled basically the whole second &amp; third month. I read that it was all normal. I was fed up, but there was still that small glimmer of light at the end of the tunnel promising painless, light, short periods. I stuck it out five whole months. \r\n\r\nIn this short time I have experienced a plethora of awful side effects. I have acne now, which rarely occurred in the past. This is not your run of the mill acne. They are all over my chin &amp; forehead. They are rooted so deep you can&#039;t squeeze them hard enough to save your life. They take a month to go away/dry up just to reoccur in little time. I have lost a lot of my hair, I now have a bald spot, I guess it&#039;s more of a receding hairline. Please know that I am SEVENTEEN. I&#039;ve dealt with excess anxiety, way beyond what is normal, crazy mood swings, constant bleeding, headaches that would last for a WEEK, &amp; the list goes on. The biggest thing for me is that I am having short term memory issues. I am positive that this is another lovely side effect that can be attributed to this pill.\r\n\r\nHad I known that these things could happen, I never would have started taking this medication. \r\n\r\nThis Dr. had failed to inform me of all of these things. I was naive &amp; I was sixteen. All she told me was that my &quot;breasts &amp; stomach may hurt&quot; while I am adjusting. That is bullshit. I do not trust &quot;medical professionals&quot; anymore. \r\n\r\nPlease do not take this medication or any other birth control medications. Do your own research &amp; don&#039;t just take your doctor&#039;s word."

I&#039;d say after the first 2 months my acne was back to normal and now it&#039;s beginning to get better. I see a lot of girls talking about how horrible it makes their acne but my dermatologist said give it 6 months and see. Try and wait it out, it will probably get better.

I just stopped taking this two days ago and within the five months that I was on it, I gained about six pounds or so. I didn&#039;t mind this at all actually, because I am quite thin and have been desperately trying to gain weight. Also, my breast size went up some. My period only just became regular this month, but it&#039;s so light that you can barely even call it a period which worried me for a while.",

My breasts definitely got bigger, and since I am in the week of my period, they are sore and tender (but I&#039;ll take it since they got bigger!). Also, I have some acne breakouts, but I always have and unfortunately birth control never seems to help and it gets a little worse around my period. Finally, the weight gain. I have gained about 5 lbs in the first two months, if that continues I&#039;ll have to get a new pill."

                "tweet_2": "I was a smoker for 45 years, one or more packs per day, and have tried to quit numerous times.  Nothing worked, not the patch, cold turkey, gum or lozenges.   With Chantix, it has been a miracle to be able to quit smoking and not even miss it.  I am currently on Day 24 of Chantix and have been totally quit smoking for 19 days!  Unbelievable.   No real urge to smoke and absolutely no withdrawal symptoms.  The only side effect of Chantix for me was a headache in the beginning (took Tylenol and it went away) and some nausea if I don&rsquo;t eat before taking Chantix.  For years I have had a lot of trouble falling asleep and staying asleep.   Had a little trouble sleeping the first night on Chantix, but I have slept like a baby every night since.  No nightmares, but definitely vivid dreams.  I think that means I am sleeping deeply perhaps.  If you are ready to quit smoking and WANT to quit smoking, Chantix will work for you."

I was nauseous and did have vivid dreams but that was minor. In trying to get myself off this medicine I find I am severley depressed. Never having this type of feeling I was not sure what was going on. I leave the house to go to work and that is it. I find myself not wanting to answer the phone when it rings. I sleep for hours...before bed time...and have no problem sleeping all night. I&#039;m very snippy towards everyone. My husband and kids are taking the brunt of this. How long will these side effects last?",
                "tweet_1": "I smoked for 15 years. Chantix is a God send. However I had two rounds of it before I quit.  It helps with the cravings and after a week on this medicine it makes the cigarettes taste awful, this was my mistake I kept smoking and got used to the change. Well fast forward another 6 months after I was off Chantix for a while I started again and stopped after about 2 weeks when the cigarettes started tasting funny again.  And that was 7 years ago. I literally owe this medicine my life. My life that I can now spend more time with my daughter and she will not grow up around second hand smoke.  It did give me nausea when I took it but only lasted from 20 minutes to an hour. But what is a little nausea compared to being able to stop smoking.",
                "tweet_2": "I rated this medicine a 10 because in my opinion anything that can help me quit smoking without wanting to kill my family and friends is great.  I was a pack a day smoker for 20 years.  I tried in the past to quit smoking but I could never last more than a day before I picked up a cigarette.  With the Chantix it made it easier to talk myself out of wanting it.  The craving was there but it made it less demanding so you could say no.  After the 3 day hump I pretty much had the confidence to just say no.  I&#039;m now 8 months smoke free and loving it, the extra money we save is going to our family vacations.  My worst side effect was the insomnia but by the time it hit I was smoke free for a month so I just stopped taking the pills."

I have smoked for 22 years and I have a new grandson in the house. The only side effect I had was constipation, but it was something I could deal with. Always take this medication just after a meal so you wont feel sick. I learned that the first week. I have been quit for 34 days and I have been off the medication for 1 week. It suggests a 12 week treatment but I knew I was ready. All of the anxiety, mood swings and insomnia come along with nicotine withdrawals, but this medication makes them so much easier to tolerate. Hang in there, the first three days is the worst, but if you make it a week, don&#039;t turn back. GOOD LUCK.",
                "tweet_1": "This medicine is a miracle! I have completed my first months pack and I am proud to say that I have been smoke free for 7 days. It took me 3 weeks to quit and I probably could have sooner but I was hanging on to my bad habit. I didn&#039;t really think this medicine would work because I loved my cigarettes and it would take a lot for me to leave them but I am so happy to say that they are gone. I do have to deal with cravings every once in awhile (especially the first few days) but you just have to fight through them by keeping your mind busy with other things and the cravings will pass. The only side effect that I&#039;ve had from this medicine is difficulty sleeping and racing thoughts. For awhile I was only able to sleep a few hours at a time.",
                "tweet_2": "I have been smoke free for my 4th day now.  I have tried several other things in the past, but did not work for me.  There was always the physical and the psychological withdrawals.  I can honestly say that I have not experienced any physical withdrawals symptoms at all, and moderate cravings.  I actually think that I will be able to finally quit smoking.  I have had some vivid dreams for the first week that I started taking the medicine, but have not had any in the last three or four days.  I would urge anyone to try this medication and see for yourself.  You will be amazed when you reach your quit date and do not feel all that bad and realize you just have to do some things to work on getting through the few minutes when the cravings come."

On Day 8, I quit smoking.  That was exactly 8 weeks ago today and I have not had a cigarette since.  The first week was the most difficult, especially the first weekend and having a few beers.  The first few days I realized how much of a habit it was and how I had structured my entire life around having a cigarette.  It was eye opening as I was a 2 pack a day smoker towards the end.  You really have to want to quit though.  Chantix is not going to miraculously make you quit.  Pick a date and stop is the best advice I can provide you.  Be confident in yourself that you can quit.",
                "tweet_1": "I smoked for 30 yrs for many years it was almost 2 packs a day. I.eventually got down to a pack a day. Over the years I tried quitting, it worked for a month Or so. My new years resolution  like any other year, was to quit. I went to my Dr and told her I wanted to quit and that I would like to try chantix. Of course I was hesitant but on Jan 9,2015 I started taking it. This was on a Sunday. 4 days..Just 4 days later I smoked my last cigarette. It&#039;s been 9 months, and I feel great!  I finished the first 2 weeks of the Rx just for reassurance. I know after taking chantix, I will NEVER smoke again! \r\r\nThank you Chantix!!",
                "tweet_2": "It took me 3 weeks on Chantix before I quit. I was worried thinking it wasn&#039;t going to work but I wasn&#039;t going to give up. I took it with food and never had any problems. I did feel some strong anxiety for a few days but I didn&#039;t blame the chantix for that; I feel it was just part of withdrawl. Within the first 3 weeks I was able to cut down from a pack a day to 2-3 cigarettes a day. After the third week I smoked the last cigarette I had and told myself I was not going to spend money on them anymore. And I haven&#039;t had any since. It was hard; I honestly enjoyed smoking; but as each day went by as a non smoker I was more fearful that if I had even a puff I would go back to smoking and all this fight to quit would be wasted."

I wanted to quit for my children/grandchildren and in particular my father.I had tried everything/ nicotine gum/ hypnosis.Nothing worked, No one thought I could quit because I was so addicted. It took a little longer than 3 months to work but it worked. I have been off cigarettes for nine years.I have not even had a drag of a cigarette in that time. I feel so much healthier and my family is grateful to have me back."

I&#039;ve always known about Chantix but didn&#039;t know how it would make me feel because I would get bad nicotine fits. I was on it for only 2 weeks and didn&#039;t want anything do with a cigarette, the smell alone made me nauseous. I didn&#039;t even have to finish the other two weeks. Chantix didn&#039;t make me depressed or have weird dreams. Yes I got irritated but that&#039;s expected. I&#039;ve been smoke free for 95 days. People can smoke in front of me and I will not be phased by it. I suggest Chantix to anyone who wants to quit and has tried all other options. You can do it!",

I got H1N1 and because of my pack a day habit my lungs were weak enough that I got double pnuemonia and was hospitalized for a week.  Almost didn&#039;t make it.  After that I started smoking again like an idiot and went to Chantix for help.  I quit in 4 days.....  By the third day the taste of a cig was so terrible that I took one puff and threw it on the ground.  I almost had to force myself to smoke.  I kept taking the pills for 3 weeks.  After that I was done.  I still have an urge to smoke once in awhile but it will take years to undo what my 15 years of smoking made me think, act, and do...",

For the last 6 to 9 months I have noticed that my life was revolving around me being able to smoke, it was like I was planning things out before-hand to be sure I&#039;d have a chance to smoke no matter what the situation was.  I was washing my hands all the time, putting lotion on and perfume to cover up the smoke smell and I would even hide my hand at the red light so other people at the red light couldn&#039;t see me smoking.  I realized how much I hated to smoke but couldn&#039;t break the habit, so I was ready.  I picked the Chantix back up and took 1 pill for one day, and two pills for a week, and quit."
